Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
Well, no...
But
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
She okay?
Did you change your hair?
Where did he go?  He was just here.
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
He was, like, a total babe
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
I just wanted --
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
What if she never starts dating?
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
You the new guy?
Get out!
Why not?
He always have that shit-eating grin?
You know French?
What makes you think he'll do it?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
You got him involved?
Will Bogey get bent?
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Leave my sister alone.
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
You and Verona?
William didn't even go to high school
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
Have you seen him?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
Why?
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
Were you in jail?
Who?
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
What?
Is that a request or a command?
Answer the question, Patrick
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
As a parent, that's my right
Was that your sister?
Which parts?
Tempestuous?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Macbeth, right?
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
I missed you.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
We should have seen land.
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
I could be gone for years.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
My letters of appointment.
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
How are you feeling, Fernando?
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
No...
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
Say not here!  Cuba!
... and also to bring medicine.
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
Why do you wish to sail west?
All of them!  Just lies!
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
May I speak freely?
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
You tell that to them!
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
But it's...
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
Back in the Czech Republic?
Now I become custody of police department?
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Did you ever turn tricks before?
What about back home?
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
You better get packed.
What are you doing?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
A cop?
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
What was that, Korfin?
I'm gonna propose.
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
Are you hit?
Who's there?
What's wrong?
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
I don't even watch TV.
What would you call her?
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
You thirsty?
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
I'm serious here.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
Is it drug related?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Alright.
Stop it.
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
Okay, til tonight.
Okay.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
Okay.  You ready?
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
Tell him to put his gun down!
How much money are you carrying with you?
Two weeks.
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
Don't fool around.
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
What?
Speak English!
Get in the bathroom!
I did.
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
We spent it!
Isn't he a little moody?
New York.
No.  Go ahead.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
I'll take him.
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.

That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
Well, that's something.
You're kidding.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
I guess not.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Well, don't worry about it.
CONTINUED
CONTINUED
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Really?
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Any ideas about the colour?
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
I understand.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
This is three years old.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
I never paid for it in my life.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
Here you go, baby.
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
You lying son of a bitch...
Bullshit.
Yeah.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
They saved your ass, convict.
Where's the goddamn car?
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
That was quick.
Why?
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
Do I get to kiss her too?
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Which one pulled the trigger?
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
I don't think your gun's loaded...
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
Hey, I don't believe it.
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Whaddya think?
Hey...
How hot are they?
Let her go.
Rosalie, you okay?
How you doing, man?
You sure?
Five.  On credit.
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
He's a she!
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
What are you doing?
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
It's a miracle!!!
Father, will you please explain what's going on?
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
Where's Leeloo?
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
At least, the cat comes back.
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
...Priest...
...What's your name?
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
Yeah?
You have nine points left on your license..
30 seconds...
Six to the left. One to the right.
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
What did you say? What did you do?
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
...Shit!
It's my wife.
You hear that?
Here we go again...
You noticed..
Where you going?
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
Why?... Why would you need me?
This is all that survived?
Talk English Doc.
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
How's our deal coming along?
Welcome home.
I'm not accusing you...
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
You couldn't?
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
Anything harder?
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
You said something about money.
I want to watch you work.
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
Where's that?
You brought the money?
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
Who is this.
Who is Machine?
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
How much did he pay you?
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
You are a private investigator?
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
You almost went over your limit.
Give me the film.
Give me the film.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Remember me?
How long you been working there?
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
A daughter.
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
Who is he?
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.
Okay.
Hello?
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
What was she running from?
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
How... how can you say that to me...?
What are you talking about... ?
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
Rick...I can't.
Alice, you think you can leave?
You alright?
I'm sure they're around.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
Kristen, what happened?
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
I've been working double shifts.
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
How long have you been awake?
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
You just feel sorry for me.
Rick, please.
Nice neighborhood.
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
I gotta get out of here.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
Who says I don't like you?
Where is he?
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
I was afraid you weren't coming.
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Did everyone call everyone?
Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
But how are we gonna --
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
I've got to write some of this down.
Mark, are you okay?
I thought about that.
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
How is he - ?
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
We're stuck tight!
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
Yeah?
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
What about down?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
As we near the Pole...
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
You're sure it's Cyclops?
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
Swell!
He did!
Well, I'll be - !
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
No.
Chub says you're fired.
Yes.
You see it?
You might not kill it.
Mmm.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Safety on?
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Saw him do it?
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Was it funny?
But it's not funny now.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
It's pretty old.
What do you want, then?
You're a policeman.
Don't go playing policeman.
On what you pay me?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
You and Mel Gordon?
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
I'm sorry.
You don't mean that.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
Money.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
Strange.
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
Coffee's perked.
What the hell are you talking about?
Hold on!
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Marg!
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Who?
Well, it was an accident.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Well, do you still plan to get married?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Which is?
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
Mom?
I don't drink coffee.
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
Oooooh, I'm good.
How was...  ...the ballet?
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
It's cut.
Uh, we got a problem here.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
Can we do that?
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
The rest of the secret service?
How many others killed?
Who did this?
How?
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
My husband is a very courageous man.
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
Four...
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
There goes your ride.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
Sir, we stay with the President.
May I speak to you for a moment?
Where are we sending it?
Did they say anything about my family?
One.
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
who can I say is calling?
You give me ulcers.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
WE'RE HOOKED!
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
Kruger, Sagittarius.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
Elaine.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
Ted!  What are you...?
Elaine.
Elaine!
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Simon just ejected!
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
I guess this is a first for you.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Have you got it straightened out now?
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
He's carrying a bomb.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
All right, it's a matter of death.
You can't go in there!
You've been hurt.
Do you want to talk about it.
No.  I mean your relationship.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
George Zipp said that?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
What did he have?
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
No. No one that I know of.
Elaine!
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
See them, Elaine?
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
How ya doing, honey?
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
Hi!
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
I like my horizons narrow.
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
Well... yes, quite possibly.
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
What is this?
Get the picture?
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
Which one is that?  Raw what?
I believe he is probably lying.
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
Stop the car.
How potent?
We?  You've taken it?
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
Hope their plumbing's the same.
You got your vest?
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
You did okay, Bishop.
No.  There's no way!
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
That's right.
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
That the atmosphere processor?
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
What's he scanning for?
So.
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
The corner!  Ready?
Now many?
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
What's this?
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
Locked.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!
It's inside the complex.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
What did you say?
Cross my heart.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
Why won't you check out LV-426?
How many colonists?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Oh - excuse me!
No! I won't have him back.
Hardly.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
You have leave to try.
Humiliated?
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
I've come to dinnnnnner!
Stop it!
Do you think that's funny?
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
No, I'm not playing this game.
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
No. Don't answer it!
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
Really?
Am I interrupting something?
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
Upstairs.
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
My pleasure.
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
And German?
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
Why not?
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
No, really!
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Are you playing a trick on me?
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Where does he work?
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
Why? What has happened?
Where?
Is he working?
Is he working?
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
How could I not?
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
Herr Sommer.
I can't say. Really
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
Really? Why?
You burned the score?
How fortunate.
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
You mean she's not coming back?
I do.
Shall I answer it?
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
Yes.
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
It couldn't be simpler.
With the tenors.
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
Is the Emperor angry with me?
No, but I'm the best.
Herr Mozart -
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
What do you want?
All Vienna has heard that.
No? Was Mozart a good man?
But not his body.
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
Can we come in?
Can I be of service, Miss Price?
Oh, Miss Price?
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
Dr. Hirsch?
No, why?
Shall I send a car?
Call me David.
Do you like it?
Now what do you want to talk about?
I was dreaming again?
Bathroom.
It's nice to see you.
Alex?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
No what?
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
All right, you two, move along.
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
You're in a hospital in London.
Lunatic?
You've never had bad dreams before?
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
I really don't know.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
Well, I like it here.
You're talking about the woman I love.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
The Slaughtered Lamb?
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
Right.
Go on, ask them.
Jack, we'd better go.
Beware the moon?
What do you think was wrong?
Say, David...
A coyote.
It's moving.
It's in front of us.
See anything?
Jack?
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
What?!
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
You're not real.
A monster. I know, I know.
Hi, Jack.
I could hang myself.
No, thank you, Doctor.
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
What can we do to assist you?
What here?
What's that?
Oh.
No, thank you.
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
About twenty-four thousand.
Yeah.
Whose death?
What's the matter, Charlie?
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
We want to talk to you.
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
Say, you can't do that
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
Oh!
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
Fifty thousand dollars!
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
What do you mean?
Doesn't that come next?
Well, what?
No.
What?
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
Why, Cyril, you're insane
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?
You haven't got a uniform?
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
Yes, sir.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
No.
What did you do with it?
Yes.
Yes.
Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?
In Cluett's office?
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
Oh, Matt . . .
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
What time was it?
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
How are you fixed?
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
I couldn't lose him.
This is healing?
Uhh, yeah it does.
This is the best score yet.
Corn gonna shoot at me?
All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
Beg pardon?
Where you boys going?
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
Jesse, we got to have a word.
What are you saying?
Missed you, cousin.
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
Well?
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
You 'um big lawman?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
Boys...
What do you say, sir?
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
Distracting enough for you?
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
You know him?
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
This has been a good year.
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Ma! Please!
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
But still died.
You're sick of my company?
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
Little ones.
I am so sorry, Jesse.
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
Hmm.
Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
We're moving you tomorrow.
Did you order our houses burned down?
Yes?
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
Was it worth it?
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Why, yeah.
Really?
Not at all.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
Good.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
The final route for the railroad is complete.
What is that?
This is him.
I want them arrested and hanged!
"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."
What the hell is that sound?
On a lot of lithium?
Yes?
Uh huh.
J&B. Straight.
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
Patrick?
I haven't seen you around here.
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
Nothing like last time, promise.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Why don t you just go for Price?
He's rich.
We need to talk.
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
Because he dated her.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
I think you should go now.
Don't come back.
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Don't, I'll drink it.
I'll do it.
Jean?
Anywhere you want?
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Jean? Sorbet?
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
Do you have a boyfriend?
Patrick? Is that you?
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
Who?
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Coffee?
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
Pardon me, but are you okay?
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
Don't you know this?
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
So...you hang out here a lot?
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
What?
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
No hash browns?
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
Yes.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
Speak up. Come on.
Shhhh...it's okay.
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
Is it over?
I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
Look at this.
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
Right. Wait. A toast.
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
My goodness.
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
Okay.
What?!
You're interfaced with our dish.
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
We could move 'em up here.
Who's that?
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
'Think I should buy some originals?
I meant did you find other stuff to --
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party to send E-mail?
I think you should go.
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
Come with me.
What've you got there?
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
I snuck into #21.
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
He's out of prison?
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
Why were you snooping in my office?
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Does he know you know?
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
What is it?
Who're these guys?
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
Care for some saki?
Yes?
Where am I?
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
Carnies.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
Let's go get him!
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Fancy a nibble?
Oh, yes you are.
Austin, may I have a word with you?
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
Hello, luv.
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
Not a good time to lose one's head.
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Oh my God, he's back.
Commander, I have to log it...
We've got a lot of work to do.
Ow! You shot me!
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
An evil vet?
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
Did you ever want to?
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
... death ...
Secret ...
How long have I been here?
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
I resign.
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
You know, I believe she's actually jealous.
That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
Choices?
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
My father always wanted a boy.
I thought we were on our way.
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Steed ... !
Where am I?
I could save you the trouble.
Because you always obey orders ...
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
What is it?
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Makes two of us.
I was getting to it.
Privately owned by ...
You're not venturing alone, surely.
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
John Steed.
You're better than I expected.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
What's happening?
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
You're kidding.
That's what we're going to find out...
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
Seventy-five hundred.
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
Great car.
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
Cole?
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Are you okay?
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
Ilene, are you crazy?
I hope Ilene's all right.
Great bathing suit.
That's it, prick lips.
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Give him the works.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
Hookers beat you up?
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
You okay?
Really?
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
Are any of those right?
I'd love that.
Feel free.
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
Ed... you're kinky!
You've been having strange sex...!
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
Mrs.?
I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
Where'd she go?
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
What's this?
How 'bout this?
He look familiar?
Hey, you guys...
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
Reach out and snort someone.
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
You gotta let me finish --
People actually used to pay you for this?
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
Thanks.
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
...Not now, Brian.
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
Anything else?
Brian.
You're back.
Huh.
I work for city hall.
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
Hey.
You think that's really any of your business?
Okay.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
Oh Jesus Christ...
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
I don't guess.
What the hell are you doing here?
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
Mr. McCaffrey...
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
What?
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Firehouse.
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
Look, I'm sorry I --
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
Didn't think you'd make it.
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
People.
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?
Are you all right, honey?
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
How's the case going?
-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
Keep trying.
...Benedict Arnold...
Everybody say Ho!
Let's go niggers!
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
Yeah, him.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head.
And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?
Seconds and thirds, too.
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
You're in this up till ya neck.
Good morning, Cheeba.
De-la-croix.
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on.
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
He never showed it.
Manray!
What is your problem?
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
How so?
Why'd you do that?
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
Peerless, your father called.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
No.
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
I never had a really real pair before.
You sing and dance?
So what's up with you and DeLa?
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
To come back to our roots.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
Not her, the one with the little...
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
I feel a song a comin' on.
A lot?
What else?
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
You're sure this is a good idea.
Stop playing me Sloan.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
I have no luggage.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?
Can I at least have a drink?
Bill Styles...
I don't want to go --
You framed-him...
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
Yeah, right...
You too?
Why not?
You did Basic here?
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
You smoke, Ray?
Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
Back up.
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
He wouldn't kill anybody...
So you killed him?
What do you mean, West's?
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
What happened to "degrees"?
He admitted it.
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Where are they!
MAYBE WHAT --
That bad?
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
Nevertheless --
They're taking your command, aren't they?
I'm sorry, Bill.
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
He's in interrogation?
Baseball?
You made me look like an idiot --
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Something like that. You?
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --
I didn't shoot West...
What?
I pushed him too hard.
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
So what now?
You know, you never told me why you left the army.
Four --
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
No bodies, no West...
What?
You're a good man, Hardy.
West?
Do I have a choice in this?
What are you doing out here?
Pike and I got separated --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
He said what?
No one else heard it?
What happened with Nunez?
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
You think he did it?
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.
The poet? What ever happened to him?
Bloom!
Can I see him?
How long have you known my father?
Well, she... uh...
Yeah.
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
Really.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
You know where the chemicals are?
I thought you weren't dying.
Son?
The river.
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
Where are we headed?
You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.
How can I convince you to stop?
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
This is why you don't show work in progress.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
It's me. Norther Winslow.
Are you Jenny Hill?
I'm going to get started on dishes.
I'm going to check on him.
I'm going with you.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
How is he?
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
Is he awake?
I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
Yes.
Do you like it?
What? What are you doing?
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
And...
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
So how long will you be in England?
I...
Binoculars.
Tell me.
Do you believe in love?
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
What did he say? Tell me!
He wants a lot of money.
So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
I do. I want to very badly.
In every sense. If at all possible.
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
Oh Jesus.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
Sometimes which?
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
Excuse me?
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
What happened between you and the blonde?
What?
She's alive!! She is not dead?
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
You can probably buy them on the flight.
Goodbye.
Whatever.
Why?
Is your niece older than 12?
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
What do you need?
Holy shit.
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.
God forgive you, for how you done me...
You better pray, gal. You better pray...
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
GODDAMMIT, RAE!
Teh... Tehronne?
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
Where's Ronnie?
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach.
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
Now you get up! And you get in my house!
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
Want another?
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
Where you gonna be?
Get'chu at that table up yonder.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
You need some weed?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
How a girl get like that?
It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this?
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.
I just wanted some make-up.
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?
Alright. How much you need, ho?
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
What's this?
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
What'd you say?
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
This should be it...
Getting very weird.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
Where do we start looking for this guy?
Nick!
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.
Know her?
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?
Nick...
What's in the box?
Nick, you can't do this.
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
Thank you.  You have one?
What's that for?
Don't be an ass.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
Can't make you change your mind?
Keep the change.
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.
What's this?
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
He knows what he's doing.
Let's go while there is still time.
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
What's the problem?
What generation are you?
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
He could?
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
What was he after?
Yeah.
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
Okay, but...
Yes?
Number three.
Prosit.
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
Taffey Lewis?
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
Yeah?
How do you mean 'exploited'?
What the fuck for?
Are you apprehensive?
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
I can imagine.
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
Who is this?
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
You know what I think?
Thanks.
Well?
She didn't know?
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
Same thing.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
What about friends?
I'm hungry, J.F.
Methuselah Syndrome.
Ah, you get hold of your friends?
Please excuse this interruption.
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
Dickhead?
What's wrong with you?
Do you own a car?
What?
Two weeks.
You got it! Wait here while I change.
Who are these people?
Wait! Wait!
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Yes.
Bites what?
They're all divorced?
Get out!
He has a computer?
In the house?
May I please be excused?
All right.
Hey, Eve!
What have you ordered?
What about her?
That's ridiculous.
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
What?
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
I know first aid!
There.
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
Hi, Eve!
What's baseball?
Like one of Mom's?
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
But, I don't understand.
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
Not on him.
Why did you park way back there?
The hotel.
What?  What is it?!
The sky?  Where?
Help you?
Hello.
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
Dad!
Right.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
All back East.
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
Well, put it down and come in!
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
How long will we have to stay down here?
Days??
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
Is there a problem?
I've noticed.
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
Should we say a little prayer first?
We stay down here.
I want him to at least see the sky!
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
So where is your roommate, the model?
I see "elegant."
That water's freezing!
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
What's that mean?
To bed?
Or have perfect table manners.
What?!!
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
Gay.
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
What do you want to do with it?
And if we can't find him?
I don't know. I like to think so.
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
Wolf One -- say intentions.
Frank. Come in.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Anything you can tell me?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Why do you do it?
You're all through with this now?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
Yes.
Do you like me?
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
Yes.
No. I should go.
Yes. Frank--
Are you a bad boy?
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
I love you Don with all my heart.
I guess I should go.
What?
Yeah, it's me.
Can I feel 'em?
Hey? You like to walk.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Nothing. I'm fine.
Well.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Are you feeling okay?
Good to see you, son.
I guess you have to get back home soon?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
What will I say when she comes to the door?
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
What did you see?
You want to tell me about it?
Yeah?
Okay, okay.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
You want to dance?
What did he bring him in for?
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.
There's ways around that.
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
Yeah, well...
Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
Shit.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.
What?! What are you doin'?
How's Uncle Sibeal?
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
Oh, Jesus.
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
Destroy all that which is evil...
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
I'm serious.
Where the fuck are you going?
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?
So what do you think?
We do not want your tired and sick.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
So, what do we do now?
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
What?
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?
How many bodies, Greenly?
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
What the...?
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
Right now.
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
Fuck you!
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
No. You sure you're okay?
You bet your ass he will.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
Yes.
Just be natural, goddamit.
I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?
Continue the joke.
Making Hutch David Soul?
How was I ridiculing you?
There's another stocker, right?
What about what that guy said?
See if mine are in there.
Yes, they are.
Inez, this is --
He's gone. He stole the car.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
He went back for his brother.
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
When'd you get back?
Who's in the car?
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
You could give somebody a concussion.
Shit, Dignan.
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
Or I might end up with a broken nose.
What are you doing?
What are you talking about?
There's not enough time.
He did?
What'd he get?
Does it float?
What's he in for?
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
No, that door over there.
Are you afraid?
Exactly. Woah.
Hector woudn't do anything.
Let them fight.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
Yeah.
How do you say nineteen?
Yeah.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Wait. Did he see us?
You don't celebrate til it's over.
Are you a fag?
I'm not allowed to drive those.
OK, Bob.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
How much could you grow? Realistically.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
What did I say?
What are you doing?
What happened?
How much is there?
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
What the fuck possessed you?
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
What do you mean get back?
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
Just get in the car, Bob.
Dignan.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
I'm sorry, Bob.
The elevator broke.
Do you have your own cell?
How long do you have to go?
Ground defense.
Is that your chiquita?
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
No. Just pool.
How's the weather down there?
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
Treadstone.
I want to know what happened.
Berlin!
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
I have to go now.
I emptied it.
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
Who sent you to Greece?
What's going on in Berlin?
-- what? --
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
Sleep. Sleep now.
But we were so careful.
You drive.
Switch! You drive!
-- it's just him? --
You hear me? I believed you.
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
It's me.
Okay, how do you want to do it?
Who?
Oh, shit...
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
Show me.
-- who? -- who else is here? --
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
It's a lot of money, Pam.
How long have you worked for the agency?
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
So he fooled you.
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
What do you think? Is he coming in?
Do we know what this says?
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
Now, my flower, do you understand?
The little cow is insane --
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
Rest, William.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
Test of manhood.
You'll move
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
Then when?
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
We can't stop!
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
You'd be surprised how often they are.
All the dads are gonna be there.
I don't know... I don't remember.
Why do you ask?
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
You're. Acting. Like your father.
How. Did you. Know that?
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Are you hurting her?
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
Are you stupid or what?
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
Not if you remember my dad.
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
Are you okay?
Because you're... different.
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
I just thought you should know.
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
Where are we going?
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
Come on, go on...
What?
Destroy it?
Look what you made me do!
I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
Lung cancer?
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
Go back to Bulgaria.
Good.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
I see.
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
Here's to you, sir.
I'd better be going.
What do you want for Sam?
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
And Mademoiselle?
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
Strange. I know so very little about you.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.
But Richard, no, I, I --
Some of the old songs, Sam.
You are very kind.
I must find out what Berger knows.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Ask me?
Ilsa, I --
Be careful.
Are you ready Ilsa?
Hello, Rick.
Well then, perhaps you also ---
Your work.
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
Good evening.
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
But we made a deal.
Yes.
I understand.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
No, Captain, please.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
I believe you have a message for him?
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
And that is?
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
I was misinformed.
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
Oh, but I just told you. --
He is traveling with a lady.
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
I have my orders.
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
Oh, it's my party.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
Make it official, if you like.
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
Boss!
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
No.
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
Get water!
Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
What's so damn funny?
Jesus.
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.
Yeah, a long one.
How was Russia?
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
Four four.  A record.
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
I have to.
That's your dog.
Get back?  From where?
I got married.
What's that?
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
Come on.  Try.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
I love you, Chuck.
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
The place is falling apart.
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
When'd you start working here?
Kamal is not here.
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
You what?
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
For the third time.
You are one sick fucker.
Hello?
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
To Wilson.
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
That's all there is.
Take your time.
What, then?
Thanks.  For everything.
May I ask, where are you bound?
It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...
I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
Why not?
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
It's time somebody ate *them*.
Is your family in the apple business, too?
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
At least you were never lonely.
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
I know, I'm sorry.
Please don't make me say it again.
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
I'm okay--I can walk.
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
That's true.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
*Liver* killed him?
What's an immigrant?
Uh... it's the end of October.
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
What kind of plane are you flying?
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
There was no visible wound?
It's obviously an aborticide.
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
I am not a doctor.
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
I'm not in trouble.
What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
Who cares?
Shit. We don't know what he is.
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
Do you know him?
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
Don't this place look like home?
*What* view?
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
Silicon Valley?
Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
We had to finalize the deal.
The Anti-Christ?
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
Nice.
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
She had you tempting fate.
We were back on.
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
So we go to the bar.
We'll take care of it.
Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.
Whoa. What?
Fuck that. We're going too.
The red hair... It's bad luck.
I'm going home
Shit.
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
It can buy you a new and better you.
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
She up for this?
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
Why not?
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
Look at you, you skinny prick.
Come here. Feel this.
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Sorry, I --
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?
What about... The money?
What do I have to do?
Uh... Everything okay?
He's gone.
I gotta go get a haircut.
How do you know I will?
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
Did, uh... Did you kill him?
You tell them the "Tale".
Yeah.
I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.
We're working for the King.
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
Him.
So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --
No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
What'd he say?
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool.
What happened?
Aces, Suits.
Pretty much.
Can I speak to you in confidence?
Still time.
Speak.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
Jack. Do you need a ride?
You're shaking.
I got scared.
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
I want to hear it.
In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
The door, Jack.
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
What?
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
Really?
Why did you take the money?
What?
No.
Yes, I know that.
I didn't.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
Is it yes?
It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
Yes.
Of course I recognised him!
You've been avoiding me.
I'm Lucy.
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Who are these guys?
Does Bella come here?
Hey Jack, join us.
Rough day?
What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
You use two alternating, don't you?
Haven't you forgotten something?
How many aces are left?
I make it six.
What makes you so sure?
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
You can start Monday week.
He's paying out in stacks of 25.
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --
The key, goddamit, the key!
Where is the key?
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
Quantum is up thirty-five.
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
This is fun.
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
Pinback...
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
What are you gonna name it?
Veil nebula.
I'm coming in now. I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock. Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
What's that, sir?
That's correct, sir.
Commander? Are you still there?
We're running out of time, sir.
Sir?
Men... men... what happened, men?
Man, you got a bad attitude.
What?
See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
Who's Camille?
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
Can I say something in my defense?
Move it.
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
But I'm afraid of--
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
I'll make it worth your while.
You're light a deuce.
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
What makes you cry?
Sophy?  Are you okay?
Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--
Sorry about your window.
Lemme get my coat.
How'd you find me?
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
I already don't like the sound of this.
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
I'm sorry.
It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
I'm looking for a lady who works here.
None.
Who is it?
I think you should go now.
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
As long as you're okay.
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
A fog bank.
Only one I can think of.
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
Who are you?
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
And she bought that?
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
Catch you back at the wall.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
And why should she?
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
For a change.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
No problem.
Sorry.
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
Shit, that dork is Jam.
Sunday, but...
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
Cool, bro, now listen up...
I found the Volvo.
Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
I did it! I did it! We won!
Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.
It's gone.
Oh, yeah! You and what army?
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
I don't even think you have a gun!
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
What was his name?
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Hey...
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
You're weird.
Where are we going?
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
What happened to your neck?
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
Hey.
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
No. Frank.
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
Grandma Death.
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
Who's been giving you weird looks?
You're my only son...
So, I met a new friend.
His name is Frank.
How are things going at school?
Who is the boss?
Can anyone else see him?
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
Because I'm so horny.
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
Where are we going, Donald?
What is going to happen?
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
If that's what you think is necessary.
Our son just called me a bitch.
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
Rose.
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
Is Mom okay?
You're what?!
What is wrong with you?
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
Oh, Amber...
I'm gonna need more caps.
Ow!
Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
I hate her!
This, this... This is bullshit!
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
Here, I didn't get any.
And the bite marks on my ears?
Hi...
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
I'm a mirror.
Dakota.
Wisconsin.
The bitch.
...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too.
Lester?
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
This is -- what?
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
Father...
What's the matter with you?
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
What kind of a dog is he?
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
You get half mine and I get half yours.
Why wasn't I insulted?
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on the up and up, So everyone beware. If anyone's caught taking graft And I don't get my share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
Are you getting tired?
When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --
That's what you think.
Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
One or two?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
What do you mean?
Yes.
More romances for John?
What are you going to do?
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
I want my man back.
Never mind that, I want my man!
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
Now I think we really do understand one another.
Good! How is the patient?
Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
Has the response picked up?
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
How long has this man been here?
I say Freddie, what are you about?
Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
Oh, no.
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
What's this?
Yes!
John... Merrick
Mmmerrick.
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness...
Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
Good evening. How are you feeling?
This... is my new home?
How long will I stay here?
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
The cathedral is coming along nicely.
...my... home?
You did this for me?
My home.
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
Open up! I know you're in there!
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
I've never LOVED anybody!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
You're as bad as my father.
We mustn't let him land!
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
Do you believe I love you?
How do we know this is the way?
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
No... we don't...
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
No. 
No.
I'll tell you what...
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
But it IS! Look!
Looting and pillaging, eh?
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
It's Halfdan the Black!
How deep IS the ocean?
Let's hack her to pieces.
That's terrible!
It's not magic! It's just a trick!
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
It's magic.
What did he say?
You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.
That's better.
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
Weren't we supposed to?
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
Are you all right?
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Who's that?
Can't make enough axe-heads!
Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
Help!
So did my father and his father before him.
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
KILL! KILL!
HOLD it! HOLD it in!
He drove me mad!
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
Thorfinn! You can't die!
I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.
Who was the girl you walked off with?
And I just liked you so much.
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
Come up to Boston with me?
I'm so excited. Yay!
Rockville Center.
Really? Because --
I'm sure you would.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
It's okay.
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
I'm not a stalker.
Yeah.
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
Frost?
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
Such a beautiful view.
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
Right. Something black though.
I dropped you off after. You said --
It's very late.
I told her today I need to end it.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
Hi there.
You know what I did.
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
I wish we did. You married?
Male or female?
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
When?
Listen, did you want to make love?
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
Hi, it's Joel.
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
You must have been crazy.
I might be making a mistake.
Clementine.
She's so sexy.
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
Naomi.
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
What? What do you mean?
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
Hi.
How was it?
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Boo.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
It's freezing out.
I swear.
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
And after that?
I really like you, Mary. You know that.
What do you want, Stan?
I know what it is.
Mary...
We can't do this.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
Yeah?
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
What's your bartlett's?
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
Where are the others?
That's Jellybean!
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
I'm cold.
Thanks.
You're the best?
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
Will it work?
You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
What's wrong?
You're not seriously considering sending him?
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
...I don't want to die...!
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
Jesus its huge.
I can see the hatch.
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
Peters...
That's a negative, Starck.
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
Explanation?
You said this ship creates a gateway...
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
We've got some weather.
Captain Miller...
Now what?
Smith, get out of there...
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
That's an affirmative.
It tastes bad.
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
Miller, come in...
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
He's engaged the override.
We have to do something, oh God...
Where is she?
You can't do that.
This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing... 
If they are, they're screening their calls.
Miller, do you read me, Peters --
What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
What is it?
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
What is it?
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
He didn't.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
Where is Reed?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
You got a chisel round here?
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Reed?... Sue?
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
No more cracks about how I look.
You're on fire!
Now what is up with that?
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
I'm driving.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
How's the IPO?
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
Feeling better?
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
Ben's still out there --
Come on, Ben, come on...
Not until Ben is back inside!
Ben did this?
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
I can't find it, mon!
Easy, mon.
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
I take out the garbage.
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
Is everything okay at work?
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
You are a virgin!
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Dad says you have to get up!
Leave me alone!
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
Are you really a virgin?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
Why don't you call me up tonight?
It's definitely your mama.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
Yo.
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
Not if you're over sixteen.
How've you been?
He is.
Seen the new Playboy?
What the fuck is this guy doing?
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
My brother's car!
My brother is gonna shit.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
So what did you do?
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
Was it great?
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
How long does Doug take?
What do you think?
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
Where's Doug?
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
Can I come in?
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
Well, you'll find out next year.
Where do you feel like going?
That's a nice shirt.
It's very warm out tonight.
You keep them.
Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
This is a nice car.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
Do you know what you want?
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
Where's Mike today?
Hi, Mark.
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
Rum and ice, please.
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
What do you mean by that?
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?
God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.
I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
Where's the medicine?
Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to...  He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!
Shoot it.
That's good...
Why?
I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
You degenerate pig!
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
Like big lizards.
Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
Adrenochrome...
Extract of pineal!
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
Stop!
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
Wha?
And that's how I ended up here.
They're right here.
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
We just smeared a skunk.
Scared?
I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
What now, Geronimo?
Your parents of relation?
We're going to get help.
We gotta be close.
Really?
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
It's much safer in there, sweety.
You wanna see, baby?
He's dead.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
Will these boards hold?
What?
What's going on between you two?
Is it gassed up?
Four door?
Open?
Max?
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
I'll go with ya.
Bullshit.
COME ON!
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
OH JESUS!
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
Let's go.
If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
What did we say about lying?
Excuse me, sir?
Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
Oh. I mean, good.

Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?
Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house...  her bedroom. I can't ask you to...
Hello, Harold.
What's up?
You don't think I'm good enough?
Who?
What does Clifford say?
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
...Don't you?
This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!
...So what do you think?
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
You're poisoning that child's mind.
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
But, Kurt, I...
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
Why... yes.
Aren't you ever going back?
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
Okay then...
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
How'd I look?
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
You don't know what you want.
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
Harry... I met someone.
You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
To quarter-horses.
Frances! Frances!
Right. Except... time has a way of --
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
Where you goin'?
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
I live here.
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
That's me, Clifford.
'But how do I know you love me?'
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
How's it sound?
Mama...
What?
I think I need a little air.
I'm back, Mama.
On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
Yes...?
This whole thing is a joke!
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
Is there something else?
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
Your crime... as well as mine.
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
And if I consent?
Nothing. Still nothing.
God took her from us.
My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
I thought I'd never see you again!
Brother and sister no more.
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
I was just clearing my throat.
Are you having me on?
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
Yes? And?
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
What happened up there?
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
Your men are right to be afraid.
We should go now.
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
You draw very well.
Any particular reason?
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
Trouble?
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
I don't hear it anymore.
It sounded like Brenda.
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
I'll be along.
You said we were special.
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
You just had some lucky shots.
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
Are you wet?
Anything else you want?
What was that?
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
Yeah, follow us.
Why do you want to stop?
What's this guy's problem?
What about Kate?
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
Not a chance.
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Who's this?
She's dead?
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
Why'd ya quit?
Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.
I don't have the slightest idea.
Why not, against your religion?
What are you going to do?
Now, is your shit together?
I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.
It's the bitterest of pills.
What's going on?
Do you believe me?
-- you got your sink --
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
Not even for lunch?
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
Were you giving that pig signals?
Best in Mexico.
Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.
Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
They're gonna search the van.
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
I don't know, you just passed out.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
How?
B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
None at this time, sir.
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
Then good night.
Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not --
I'm saying, we're just friends.
Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
Ah, c'mon...
Think I overplayed it?
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
"Coronado."
Should probably ask him that.
Then I suggest we start there.
Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?
Hey.  You okay, Flea?
Time.
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
Lieutenant O'Neil.
So why're you even considering it? Are you?
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
So why are you telling me this?
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
No shortage of suspects.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.
I'd sure like to know who.
Hey.  Way to gut it out.
You really came back for more?  Of this?
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
At first.
I can't go out.  Not like this.
32 feet, six inches!
Permission to get dressed, sir?
Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.
England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
Say again?  How many micks?
O'Neil...
Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
That's cuz I'm married to you.
That why you dumped him?
He stole my report! That's my report!
Animal, I can't.
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!
If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape.
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
What the hell are you doing?
Did you talk with Humphries?
I can't.
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
Really? A girlfriend then?
We've secured the doors on both levels.
They didn't make it.
What sample?
The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled.
You gave them the tape?
General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
I need you to trust me.
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
I understand.
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
You WILL go out there.
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
Go ahead!
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
Not again...
You were holding it upside down weren't you?
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
A boy comes to the door.
Oh my god, It's real.
WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
Those blue things ate everybody here?
He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
You said "the Commander.
He always has to make the big entrance.
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Yes...?
What do you mean?
Go. They're off again.
Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
U.... What do you think?
... What does that mean?
Covalent... Right. So...
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
Oh, they're so cute.
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
We're screwed... We're so screwed...
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
More to the left... Stay parallel...
They're gone.
We're alive!
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
There's nobody here. Jason...
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
Can it be repaired?
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
Clenched jaw...
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
You gotta admit, they do love him.
We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
Tommy, look!  Those lights...
Explain -
You... You mean Earth?
Former Commander?
Commander...
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me.  Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
Let's do it, Tommy.
Continue forward, sir?
Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
I hope I never have to believe that.
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
You, you just need a new flint, General.
Me?  You apologizing to me?
You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought.
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!
We've got powder but no ball!
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
Partially...
Any word from Canada?
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
These supplies...?
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
That's right...
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
Martha... what?
But, you do come from a military family?
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
They can use their imaginations.
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
All people have rights!
You're kidding me, right?
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
Who?
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
He's around someplace.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
She's... young.
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
You know how to write one of these?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
She's great. Gimme the money.
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one.
Hello? You there?
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Sovereign.
You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
You live in Miami?
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
I want you to.
Come on, Harry - Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
So he comes to L.A...
Ever shot anybody.
You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
What's it called?
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
One of his best parts.
You don't even know these guys.
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
We talk different?
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Whatta you think, Chill?
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
It's not one of these?
The door from the patio, in back.
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
You saw that one?
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
I got you a copy of the script.
I think it's not horrible.
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -
Were you scared up there?
I'll be right back.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
He already knew it.
Oh, for Christ's sake -
But you are interested?
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
What day is it?
Maureen.
You think that's funny
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside.
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
Went aboard.
It's a hell of a lot of money.
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
Can't you use something else?
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
Yeah.
What the hell happened!
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Don't fall asleep.
What's slow?
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
Coffee.
What?
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
What'd you find up there?
She was sailing up north, right?
I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
Got your light?
Smashed it up pretty bad.
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
What do you think happened on this boat?
What happened.
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.
Murphy to Epps.
Epps? You there?
What do we do with him?
Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
What?
You killed them.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
What's this?
No, no. You got leak.
Will you get off my back for once?
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Give up?
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
It's not optional!
Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
Aren't there a million places like this?
Do you want something to drink?
When did I say I hated you?
Yeah, well --
How long have you been up?
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
Hey - why do you have this?
There's my dad with Joanie.
I want to do him!
Look, maybe that's him!
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
Do you think he knows?
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
What? How long have you been standing there?
JOSH!
I'll bet he never jerks off...
That guy is totally amazing.
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
That rules!
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
He gives me a total boner!
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
Now are you going to get a regular job?
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
How repulsive!
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
Do you want anything?
We're not.
Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
You still interested in that?
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
Hi... what's your name?
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
Five hundred.
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Really? Can I see it?
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
Well are --
Uh, I don't have much money with me right now.
Relax, Seymour, relax...
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
What did you tell that girl?
It's not hopeless...
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Aren't you going to get that?
Uh... hello?
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
Boo!
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
Just someone so young...
Uh... sure... come in.
I'm just being realistic.
I hate sports.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
Yeah, sure. Of course.
You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
What do you want?
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
Talk to us about it...
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
I don't know.
Let me see the sick.
-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."
How lucky we are.
All right- thee second embankment will go there. 
Second death? Where?-
We need to talk.
I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
...misfire... it jammed...
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight.
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
I am also liaison between these two.
What are they looking at?
Afraid of lions.
Why so many?
Where do you go next?
Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
Everybody has a choice.
What are you working on, Egon?
Oh no.
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
Hello, Peter.
Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
Is this the spot?
Sorry!
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
Who are you going to call?
Well, good night, Louis.
Should we go?
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
These boys aren't playing around.
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
You were supposed to help me with this.
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
Rivers of the stuff!
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
And now you're going to eat it?
This is what you do with your spare time?
Like a goat on garbage.
I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
What's your story, Pete?
And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
Now that's one ugly dude.
Are you all right?
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
And pure --
Now where are you going?
Oh, Dana, it's you.
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
All right.  Since you put it that way.
Do you want this body?
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
But why?  The students love us!
That is one speedy mutt.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
What's that got to do with it?
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
Great!  How's it going?
And may I see this storage facility?
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
All right.  What is it?
Circle?
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
What on earth gave you that idea?
Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
Don't cross the beams.
All right.  I'll try.
Where's the Keymaster?
You talked to Gozer?
No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!
I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
I told you it's real.
Anything!  Just make contact.
You'll never regret this, Ray.
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
Do you believe in God?
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
Stantz?  You okay in there?
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
I should at least have you, don't you think?
Those are priceless sculptures.
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
I want that bastard dead!
Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people?  Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break!
Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them!
Give away food?
Take grain away from the army?
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
Tribuus!  Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia.
My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.
The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors.
I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the business of every soul in the empire.
Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
Servis made it through again?
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
I made the plume from a quail feather.
Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?
It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
Before they leave, get gold.
Hello.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Do you always drive like this?
I want to go home.
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
We won't. Let's go inside.
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Benjamin -- do they know you?
And it's all over now.
What's the matter?
Elaine --
Don't cry. 
Is it because I'm here?
I don't understand --
Let me go.
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
What are you looking for?
What are you going to do now?
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
Benjamin?
You won't?
But you might.
Is that so? You might marry me?
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
We just can.
You really will?
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
What are you then?
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
Mr. McCleery?
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
Mrs. Robinson?
I'm putting it here by the door.
Where are you?
Where is it?
What do you drink? Bourbon?
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
Oh my God.
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
What do you think?
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
Thank you.
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
He didn't see me.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
To tell you?
Well.
Yes?
On your first time --
That you're afraid --
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Do you want to hear it or not?
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
What do you say to him?
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
Now let's keep going here.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
What?
Well I can't.
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Oh no. In the car you did it?
Good.
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
Did I say that?
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
No -- actually I'm not --
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
I do.
When did you two talk this over?
I'm just --
I don't know. I want it to be --
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
Thank you.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
But why?
Yes?
Yes?
Is anything wrong?
They came all the way from Tarzana.
Turn 'em up.
I oughtn't to presume, but I --  I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!
And what are you going to do?
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
Need any help?
No -- no -- no -- no...
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
I'll pay you back.
I have an idea working in my head... 
You?
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Why?
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
Going?
Why do you look at me like that?
And -- and --
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
Strange man...
I want to be alone.
Why do you smile?
That's a silly joke.
There.
I'll not denounce you.
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
Very early in the morning.
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
I can't.
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
I'm worried about you.
Thank you, sir.
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
Then you know him?
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
Hello -- sorry I'm late.
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
If we could scare up some men to play.
Is that too much, Baron?
Goodnight, Kringelein. 
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
And the child isn't coming?
I don't know.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
You're a very unusual stenographer --
What is this?
What brown hands you have.
Cotton Company --
How nice -- your daughters?
Yes.
I must go to England -- at once.
Of course -- of course. 
Can you pay some attention to me?
Insolent young cub!
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
How clear is Manchester?
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
Shall I tell them again?
Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep. 
Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
Oh, come, Madam -- please come. 
Madam should sleep.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
Good morning, Pimenov.
Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
We will wait.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
Next week.
What's bluff?
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
What do you want with her?
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
You wanna talk to me straight up?
Your what?
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Right in front of the room.
Want a look?
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
Yes, yes, but that's --
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Sounds like a good Idea.
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
Sure.
I tripped over a chair.
Expecting visitors?
You ought to put a bandage on that.
I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
You heard the shower, didn't you?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
Big spender.
No.
You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.
Working the what?
You're on the grift. Same as me.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
What?  What for?
You -- I don't know.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?
Sure. Let's get it over.
What?
Well, thank you. And thank them.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that?
Carter.
That's it?
Carter.
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
He found you, didn't he?
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
Not me.
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
It's John, isn't it?
What are you looking at?
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.
You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
I have to pee.
Fuckin' A.
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
You've been watching too much TV.
Promise?
What should I do?
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
My, God!  What have you done to him?
What is that?
There you are.  Who was that boy?
There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
No!!!
Yes?
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
Hm?
A bitch.
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
You know what gets me?
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
I've been looking at motorcycles.
Otherwise, how are things?
Huh.
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?
Hello.
I wanted to apologize.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
What an awful sound!
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.
Sir?
Hello.
You were about to ask a question?
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
College?
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
You're supposed to get hurt!
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
Why don't you go to bed--son.
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
Play?
Can I get dressed first?
Dad--
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
What's this?
That's a rifle you have?
Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?
"Hamburger Heaven."
Can I help you, sir?
Disease?
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
Please--
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
Breakfast?
And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.
Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
What then?
Go on.
You learned this in some college course?
The doctor.
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
A dozen?
Did you like it, dear?
He knows you shattered his violin.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
You're begging him to kill you?
No you don't.
Honor, I suppose.
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
Ooops.
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
We have, have we?
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
Here.  Finish the job.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
Thank you--for my life.
What happened?
I'm only ten years old.
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Kid--kid--
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
He's a ghost!
I don't really know.
Where will you be?
Yeah.
My father!
It's fine!
It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
Coming.
The park!
Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
What's the matter now?
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
Get out of here.
Phooey.
We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?
Yeah.
Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
What?
What do you mean?
Now, what do you want?
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
Man, how many girls do you need?
Nah.
Are you a private detective?
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
Jesus.
Neither am I.
Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer.
Granville?
What happened?
Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.
Mast?
I don't know.
Where is she?
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
The police? They know less than you do.
I'm only human, you know.
Do the police want to arrest me?
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
What is it, Jake?
What happened?
How's your business, Jake?
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
Hey man.
Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff.
I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in... interesting things.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
It's a short film.
You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
I don't know.
Com'on, tell me.
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
You can fuck off, too.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
You are at the University, Candy?
Lady, let me get this straight.
Okay, lady. Out.
But there is a family resemblance.
Check.
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
And what do you do, my dear?
How interesting.
What do you see?
Here's your shovel.
Eh, no. Thank you.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
Sort of.
All right.
All right.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
No. 
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
No.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
I think he's following us.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
No. I'd feel stupid.
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
Don't you advance on me.
Just like this.
Look at the stars.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
Yes.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well?
Mother.
Mother.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.
Fifteen.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
Would you care to talk about this friend?
Then why did you leave?
We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
How about to slit his throat?
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet.
Yes... Yes. You look...
What do you mean?
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
O.K. Let's go.
I'm scared.
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
What the hell was that? An ape?
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
Don't look! Turn around.
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use...
-- should go back. Now!
Thank you.
Whatcha looking at, John??
I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
You want me to hold him down?
Where do you --
Are you sure about this?
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
Goodnight, then.
You're going alone?
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
It's freezing, isn't it?
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
It's my lucky day.
What's happening?
That your daughter?
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
No time for argument.
Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that?
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
Oh my God.
Well can I come in or not?
Julia.
Help me.
...somebody...
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
-- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
So where's the harm?
Don't you care?
This afternoon.
No, damn you --
It's ONE of these.
Not exactly modern.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
He's here?
Take it slowly.
You're done worse.
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Larry...
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
You know, you're very beautiful.
Where are you?
What did you say?
You'd like the house.
Big house.
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
What are you drinking, love?
Yeah.
It's like she's waiting for something.
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
Where are you going?
We're on the Cointreau.
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
Can I lend you a hand?
'Bye.
Do I know you?
Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
You gotta be kidding me.
Don't you want to hear what's next?
Yeah.
What did you tell her about the shop for?
We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us.
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does "yet" mean, anyway?  "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it?
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
Why would they care?
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Like fuck you are.
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
That's what I said.
He's got one!
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
Oh.  Okay.
Is there a difference?
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
Are you all right?
Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that --
Well we rang $900 today.
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
Can I help you?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Shit!
So you weren't interested in music at all?
What were the others?
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
I suppose so.
You won't like it.
Of course it is.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
So, how are you?
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
I'm sorry.
Me?
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
No.  Probably not.
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
So?
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.
Rob here.
Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
Hi, Mom.
It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.
We're not there yet, Justin.
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Would you like more tea?
Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
Who?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
He sees me as a threat.
You want me to front for you.
There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?
I hope I never get that old.
Yes.
I didn't kill the watchman.
What is it you want?
Get out.
What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four people?
I want Taupin.
What were you doing in Felton?
Who is it?
I was driven out.
Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
I'm twenty-two.
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
But we cannot be killed.
How can I stop such a man?
It will take less effort as you learn.
You have a gift.  One you must protect.
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.
Complete your inspection?
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
What is your position?
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
Any other I.D.s come up?
Where!
The last four.
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
How did you find me?
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
He found us even there.
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
I want you to come to me.
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
All I need is time.
When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
You're one of William's kids, huh?
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
The five hundred? Sure.
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
Mother? But your mother --
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
I'm beginning to realize that.
Well, she'll know some day.
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
Ts! Ts! Ts!
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
Get out!
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
What do you mean by that?
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
You can't sell me that, Walter.
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
Afraid? I should say not!
You said it.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
What do you think I am -- a crook?
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
When did you deliver this first?
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
Hildy!
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
What!
Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail.
You stay here. I'll find out everything.
Who do you want?
Sure, boss.
How much?
I call. What you got?
Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
Boy, did you see her go?
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
Just a minute, Johnson!
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
After all I've done for you --
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.
Pure politics!
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
Shoot to kill, I said.
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
Who is this man?
Got you, Williams!
You'll take fifty and like it!
Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back. 
Come on with that money!
Here!
Mother!
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Don't talk too loud.
How'd you get here, Earl?
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you. 
You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right. 
What's he want?
That was a googly!
Give him the you-know-what.
Only till they get you into the local school.
What are you doing here? This is our territory
You want to join our gang?
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
Crocodiles! Aah!
But Dad, It's the News.
Boy, that was some air-raid.
And Jim.
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
Why not?
How's your war, Mac?
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
No Turks.
We don't know anything about it
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
It looks a bit fishy to me.
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
It's not fair on them. It's selfish to keep them with you.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
You're having me on, Molly.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
Tiny's home.
Which way?
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
Is your brother ready to go?
He left!
Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
What the hell are you laughing about?
Why? You gonna do something about it?
What's this?
Oh yeah, I remember now.
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
I hope you fixed the spare like I asked ya.
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
Should we stop?
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
How much is a person supposed to stand?
Drive through it!
Come on, get with the facts.
Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
Fuck, it's freezing.
Why?
Yeah?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
Oh, right.
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
This is way too fucked up for words.
I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you.
Where's Bill?
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.
Grampa... watch the language.
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
Turn up this road.
Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?
Don't worry, we'll find her.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
Over.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
You decide. Today is your day.
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
Oui.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
My little French.
Like what?
Well?
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
Lila?
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
You what?
That's what I'm counting on.
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
Yeah?
No. I married a midget.
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
Yeah. My brother told me.
Rose, please go away.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
I'm sorry?
Boy, this is good!
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
I'm sorry about my parents.
Flares?
Come on.
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
What are you doing in there?
Who is it?
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?
So, how's it going today?
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
It would just be helpful to know.
I think he's ready.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
Interesting.
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
To win.
I'll make it up to you.
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
Make it twenty.
Only when I work.
Character.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
I never saw you do anything else.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
What happened to you anyway?
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
What's the matter? What happened?
I can beat him.
I'll beat him the next game.
Well, here it's half.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
Who's he?
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
The expensive kind.
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
It's gonna cost ya money. It always does.
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Hey, how much are we ahead?
Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
With what?
HOW MUCH?!
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
Findley.
When?
That's right. When?
Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
Hey, uh, mister? Hey, okay if I grab a cue?
How much are you ahead?
Okay, friend. You're on.
How long have you been waiting?
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
A day like any other. People come, people go.
Where you been all day?
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."
What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?
I'm hungry.
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
What are you writing?
Give it to me.
Well, he owns things.
Well, what else does?
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
Oh, grow up.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
Hundred dollars?
That's what the game's all about.
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
Do you remember where you lived?
Who is this?
I don't know.
You want me to stay?
Do you still want me to stay?
Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
I surrender --
Son ... are you awake?
Is the hill ours too?
Jim -- what's wrong?!
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
What happened to you?  Who was that?
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
Why?
Where, Jimmy?
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
Did you call the State Police?
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
You're being paranoid.
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
I don't know how you put up with him.
No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
Not really...
Pops!
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
Spunky?
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
You punched the President in the face?
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
This I can see.
Thanks, Pops.
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
We're loose!
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
How're we doing?
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
This is ridiculous.
With their shields down it might be possible.
How do you know?
It's doing what?
Your son.
So, what do you do for a living?
Oh. Sorry.
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
What the hell's going on?
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
Can they be killed?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
My reputation precedes me.
Your treat.
Dad?
Venice, Italy!
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
Ah, Venice...
How's the head?
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
Henry! What are you doing here?!
Look what you did!
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
Are you expected?
Tapestries?
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
An old man's dream.
Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
You could be more right than you know.
Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
Doctor Jones?
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
It would make me very happy.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
Don't wander off.
At least I let you tag along.
What do you know about this place?
How did you get here?
All I have to do is squeeze.
Dad, they come in through the doors.
What am I looking for?
Dad!
Stop!
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
Dad, are we hit?!
This is intolerable!
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
Dad?
The penitent man is humble before God.
Uh-huh.
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
Interested in local curios?
What?
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
I was dubious myself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones...
Now what about the antidote, Lao.
You got the tickets, Short Round?
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
No, the stones are mine!
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
What'd he say?
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
Took what?
What'd he say now?
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
A what...?
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?
What about the future?
The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
Any more complaints?
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
Get -- the -- bug -- off!
Oh no -- oh no!!
Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
Figures...
Give me your hat...
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
My name is AL.
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
Who was it?
Al.
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
My place, can't you see?
Yeah...Who?
Quit screwing around, this is important.
I told you, my name is Al.
What for?
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
Why he's argumentative?
You weren't listening!
What's that?
What do I do?
Calm Down! Act rational.
I don't know...To get Al.
It can't take that long.
JOE Or what?
You are CRAZY!
I did. I brought you back here.
Thanks.
Corridor A.
A lab and equipment.
That's not a good idea.
Who is it?
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
You mean...just leave.
...and a license to kill...
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
She's...pretty fast.
Touch her.
Mind your own business.
Get close to them.
Even Rene?
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
What Happened?
No. What do you hope? AL  I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?
Osaka.
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
Door to the right. Get up and run.
He was with Gruner!
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
Dieter!
Be quiet.
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
JOE What abilities...?
Not that truth!
What is your name?
I'm against it.
What kind of a deal?
What happened?
They have stolen state property.
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
Sir?
Yes?
Enough ROmance.
...Foreign service.
You may not remember things.
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
Right.
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
Fine. You look fine.
Well...
We're here.
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Al?
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
The fresh tuna?..
What did you say?
Then who did?
The poet...something he said...
Let you leave without it.
What way?
And you?
Promise you what?
Joe! What happened to you?
Why?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
A chip. Goes in a computer.
Hiroshima.
Where what?
If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
What?
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
Chiang Cho?
So do I.
I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
Now what?
Don't worry.
He can't help us.
What could you find in this place?
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
You can't take that.
Yes.
The other working.
Look, nobody knows we did it.
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
He's into kind of little cars, that...
Yeah.
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
When's your deadline?
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
Alright, alright.
What are you cooking?
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
What the hell are you doing?
So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.  As they start to leave...
Mike... Mike... Mike...
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
Hello?
Yeah?
Why?
You ready...?
Is there any more rice...?
What do you need at the store?
Thank you, Bob.
Jeffrey Wigand...
Yeah...
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Alright?
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
Oh, man.
Lowell.
Did I get you up?
Give me a break!
How have you liked your stay?
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
Did work.
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
What did you get us?
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
Excuse me. Yeah...
Jeff...
No? No, what?
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
ABC Telemarketing Company.
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
What are you talking about?
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
"I would bet on it."
"You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
Hello.
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
Is that a threat?
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
I don't need it.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
You're in check.
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
Marylin! What have I done?
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
It sounded like a bell.
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
How nice.
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
What is it you're after, Miles?
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
Hello?
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
She never particularly cared for me.
Apparently she was very disappointed.
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
Good.  Are those foods?
I have a surprise for you.
Miles? You're scaring me.
Comfy!
I want to nail you ass.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
Arty Farty stuff.  Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
Wait! He works for YOU?
Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
Hello Marylin.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
Pre-Castro.
Sweet.
We are. And it's winding down.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Hello, Rex.
I was devastated. Of course.
Is this a lover?
Wow.
Miles Massey.
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
Is this Ming?
But you're going through with it?
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
My client has ruled that out.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
Ah.
Wait... He wants to give her...?
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
Berry spoons.
Wrigley?
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . Just between you and methose things give me a stiff pain.
Mr. Warne?
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourselflong ago.
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Oh, come now
Well!
I'd like to have a talk with him.
Peter Warne! 
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
What would you like to have me do?
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for meand maybe we'll be friends  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
Don't want to talk todon't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
All right, let it go.
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
Whadda you want!
What do you think you're doing!
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it.
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
Here, boy!
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
Hey, Brat!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
Darn clever, these Armenians.
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
That, I suppose, makes everythinguhquite all right.
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came firstthen the tiethen the shirtnow, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Here
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
Where'd you say the showersand thingswere? 
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Oh, so now I was drunk!
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
Yeah.
Not a one.
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
Uh-huh. Want one?
I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away. 
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
You think it's simple, huh?
Here comes a car!
What're you going to do?
You might give me a little credit.
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
Any luck?
I hope you got your money.
No harm in your coming to see us.
You bet we did.
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
Up yonder. See the lights?
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
Get out of here!
Joe, listen
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
Huh?
If it's on the level.
I'd put you there myself.
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
You send telegrams here?
Send it collect.
Mebbe.
Yeah.
Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world.
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
Five G'sor I crab the works.
Sh-sh-sh! Soft pedal, you mug!before I What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thingand you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
If you don'tEver hear of Bugs Dooley?
Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
And Oswald?
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
Yeah.  They were seen together in Clinton in early September.  The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
You still questioning any Cubans?
I'm caught in the middle.  They're after me.  It's almost over.
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
What about Ruby?
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
I want the truth.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
I'm not sure I understand.
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
And if you're wrong?
They killed him, honey.
Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful.  All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
Sure sounds like he's winning.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
What'd ya mean?
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
Why were you with him?
And you didn't tell the Police?
What's she willing to give us?
You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?
I'm not a loser.
Help yourself.
But now you're telling us now you do.
You don't want much, do you?
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
I don't think so.
Is it dark?
You gain weight?
What have they told you?
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
What'dya think?
If you're having some.
You get a chance to use it?
Thanks, but I have my own now.
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
How do you feel about getting old?
Really?
It's different with men.
Does it happen to all men?
Who was your girl before Annette?
What're you, a bag lady?
You're avoiding the question.
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
Got another gun and a stun gun...
You do that?
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
You're rationalizing.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Where's the rest of it?
What if he checks it?
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
In a dress.
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.
We're partners.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
If I don't cooperate?
Sometimes every day, for a while.
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
You ever see him sell guns?
Then how do you know he sells guns?
I'm recording this.
The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
Not yet.
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
What did you do after that?
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
I have no idea.
How long you been with Ordell?
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
What's that fucker ever done for us?
I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?
Beaumont Livingston.
Yeah?
The Cockatoo Inn.
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
Drink?
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished.
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
Is it ready to go?
Want a Metrix?
I thought you were sixteen.
Were you a disco girl?
So where did you go?
With Ordell?
C'mon, don't lie.
That's a picture of me in Japan.
About five years ago.
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
Lemme have the bag.
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
Thanks, Baby.
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
Who was Beaumont?
I didn't look like a bum.
She believed you?
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
You shot Melanie?
You couldn't just hit her?
You shot her twice?
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
Where you shot her.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!
I need your name and address.
You didn't hear?
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Where is it?
What's up with this shit.
You know who this is?
What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
I'm alone.
Well, give it to me then.
This place stinks.
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
Uh-huh.
It's the next street.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
Cherry Bail Bonds.
Get me out of here.
Dream on!
Hiya Jake. That was some dance.
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
Daddy. Let go.
Short? It's ended.
Hello.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh?
You mind? I'm eating, huh?
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
She hates me, Louis.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean.  I need to know about ... demons.
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
What was that?
I'm not cold.
She was good in bed, though.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
They stole it.
That help?
What do you think?
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
Wait. Don't.
I'm going home.
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
What do you mean? Where do you think?
Why? What for?
Can't you stop it?
What the hell are you doin'?
What'd the doctor say?
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
How come? The army?
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
Are you out of your mind?
What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Where have they gone?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
Why won't you answer me?
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
Where are they?
Oh God!
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
Clear the area. This is an order!
Speaking.
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
I don't know. I don't know.
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
No one knows. They say it blew up.
I have some ice from the machine.
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
He's not part of the program.
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
Can we blow it with just two?
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Where the hell were you?!!
Nice touch.
We're not supposed to do that.
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
We'd need charges.
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
I'm with you kid.
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
Pull me in!
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
Hey.
My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
See? We're not so bad.
You wanna release your air tanks?
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
I'll help you in.
He's trying to ask you out on a date.
Close the fucking door!
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
I'm gonna spew.
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
You're quicker than usual.
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
What do we do?!!
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
Robot huh?
Kay-Em, you okay?
Kay-Em we made it!
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
What?
The power's back up!
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Yes!
Guys, he's right behind us!
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
I never saw one that big.
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
Probably out in the back yard.
Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
Love ya.
It's three feet deep, Martin
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland.
Only 24 hours!
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
What's that?
What? What?!
...Nothing.
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
Where'd you get all this?
I hope we get some more help.
Think she might've run out on you?
Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there.
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No?  What's he playin' here?  Put the gloves on!  Let's see who's gonna tease who now!
I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
20 feet, if it's an inch...
Follow him!
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
So, what do you think we should do?
Is that normal?
You're being really immature.
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
You know it's okay.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Hey man.
What is your job title, exactly?
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
No.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
No.
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Oh.
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
I know what junk is.
We definitely want it to have junk.
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Cold feet.
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
But I thought you'd be cool if...
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
You should try Adderall.
Oh my God...
Juno? What's going on?
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
Excuse me?
Yeah, like people in love.
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
Is this Juno?
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
The Penny Saver sucks.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
Touche.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."
Juno, what's the matter?
What did you do?
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.
Hi, I'm Adele.
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
What's this?
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
What if they're dangerous?
Yeah but, what is it?
This the book your writing?
Now why is that?
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance."  "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
...never?
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
...Janitor's job.
Could be.
...Diebold?
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
You wanna go to Paul's house?
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
It is right.
I hate this game.
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
I don't understand why you do that.
So really, it's good luck.
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
Nah.
Where you at?
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
You sure?
Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
Sup. Sup.
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
I was lookin' for you all day today.
Do you like kissing me?
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
You know what I want to do?
What do I want to do?
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.
I'm sorry.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
Wish me luck.
I'm coming.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
Oh shit.
So that's why Casper is how he is.
Yep.
Mom.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
Hello?
Yeah.
It was... it was.
By yourself?
Casual.
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
Take it easy.  Both of you.
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
You alright?
Ready for round two?
Why does he call Sanderson?
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
And you want these girls to feel your pain?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
Hello.
What word did you leave last night?
By that time the game will be over.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
I know where you are.
Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
No problem.  We're in.
There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
What scars?
You might not have done it had you known.
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
You must be Erica.
Is your dad here?
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
I know he really likes you.
What are you doing up?
Who told you that?
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
What do you think he did?
I'm busy right now.
Kathy?
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
Did you see his face?
This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
What have you come up with on the riddle?
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
Did you send the car?
It's a good play, but risky.
We got a problem?
Bainbridge Books.
Is this your first time here?
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
Are you with the tournament?
Are you one of the players?
Do you always open quickly?
What are you looking for?
Do you?
Doesn't that scare you?
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
Wasn't I just talking about me?
Alright.  What about me?
I'm not playing a game now.
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
I'm hungry.
The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
Peter...
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
Me too.
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
That's a better one.
The new Queen lives.
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
<u>Why</u>?
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
The spiral begins in the west.
She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
I can. Because I choose it.
Let me comfort you.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
I don't think you'll grow careless.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
When did you last sleep, boy?
Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
We could reach it on fire-mares.
You're resourceful, my lad.  I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.
Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
I'm hungry.
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
Modred! Impossible!
Can you see?
We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.
The leader of the Dark Ones?
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
She was not as beautiful.
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
Give me his name, I will mail him.
...Office 2702.
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?
...You moved too, didn't you?
No, no.
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
Mathilda? May I come in?
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
Not taken.
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
...Don't you drink?
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
May I ask you a personal question?
Don't fear.
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
...OK... Good.
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
Salute.
What is it?
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
What if you don't make it?
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
What would you like us to do?
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
The new store?
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
No.
Your father?
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
Why?
You don't have to prove anything to her.
Red flags man.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
A marriage certificate?  Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
Well, hello.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
This story is big huh?
Where?
The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.
I haven't been too punctual with the rent.
Are they standing?
Come on Mr. Parker.
She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.
In a hospital.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
Hello, Mr. Parker.
There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.
Orange soda?
Coffee?
Are you working?
Sarah -- with an H?
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?
Sera...
Sera you are crazy.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
Sera... what you don't understand is...
Ben?
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
What do you mean?
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
I like it here with you.
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
How'd this happen?
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
A full night on the street and this is all?
But it's a top three school --
You understand you're on trial for murder?
Were you with another man?
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
Did you get it?
Good work today, Ms. Woods.
I'm sorry, but --
You're hitting on me?
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
Yes?
Yes?
Good one.
And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
Uh -- family.
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
Too demure?
Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
Keep June first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. And give Warner our love.
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.
Good luck.
Why?
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
She's not!
I can't.
You really think I'm attractive?
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
So now you're -- ?
Up for a celebration dinner?
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
Someone missed you.
How could this happen?
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?
Neither.
I did?
Amazing how?
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
That's not entirely --
So -- uh -- how was your first class?
Good. Good.
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
You look -- nice.
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
And what is your boyfriend's name?
She's naked.
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
Is it a Kappa?
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
Let's all go! Road trip!
There he is!
Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
We go out, smash 'em now?
We watch... good fun...
Your love.
You're magnificent.
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
No more... please...
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
You're a beast!
You come stealee tleasoo?
Friend Ogg.  Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.
Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
Enough!
I meant no disrespect.
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
But... but, why?
Don't you know?
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep.
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
What is it?
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
We must follow that bird.
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
Beware.
This is ogre's magic.
Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.
Nice piece of work.
I pray always to be worthy of it.
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
Wait, Jack.
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
You see!  You see!
Look at that shot!  Three at once! I can't miss!
Aye... my Lord...
How're these?
These for me?
What shall we do?
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
Where are you going?
They tricked you.
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
Its powers are strong.
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
What's the matter?
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
No!
This is sad news, be it true.
And charmed, of course.
In every way.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
What do we do now?
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
Praise be to God.
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
Is he a friend, then?
In a dream.
I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
What's that for?
Oh.
Atonement.
I had them in my pocket.
You're a good girl.
My mother would die.
You should stay.
Where's your dad?
I can't even take a shower here.
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
Josh said...
Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
You'd hate him for the trick.
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
Why is that?
He's at work while I'm here.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
I have the permit.
Pardon me?
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
Right...she married...what was he?
Forty.
Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
I've got one favor to ask.
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
No one would blame me if I left!
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
I'm leaving.
Where is it?
You can't make me do a thing.
I know the feeling.
What would you like to be?
I know parts of who you are.
What would you be doing now?
If I asked you to stop, would you?
Are you talking?
Why wouldn't she leave?
After everything.
You look better than ever.
I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
I just wanted to know where Mom was?
I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
One of you would end up dead.
What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
What is it?
It's not breakfast yet.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
Oh...with his ear infection!
With your hands or your tongue?
Where's Sam?
Do you need help?
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
Peter left me yesterday.
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
He said he heard hammering.
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
I can't go right now.
What are you doing in my room?
There were no PG's.  So I just gave them money to play games.
The door was open.
All day again?
I brought a few of my own.
Nothing R, okay?
A night in the hole?
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
No, but...
Yeah.
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
You know I trust you, Claude.
Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?
Engagement ring!
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Don't I know you?
What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
Maybe we oughta find another place.
Guess we better get going, huh?
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
Man, this is gonna delay everything. Spanky's gonna be pissed.
This fork is filthy.
No, man. I want you to have it.
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
What'd you say?
Don't mention it.
All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon.
We'll just get off at the next stop.
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent.
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
Crawfords.
I don't see you coming up with any plans.
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
Don't make me take them away from you.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
What'd you say?
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
What is that?
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
You mean Louis Armstrong?
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
What are you doing here, mama?
I can't take that, mama.
I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.
Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
What's the Boom Boom Room?
Where'd you get this?
I'm interested. Keep talking.
If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
What's Nicky doing down there?
Makin' friends already.
This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
You're a good devil, Dad.
You came through, Nicky.
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
Easy, Liberace.
There's our man.
What's with that guy?
You sure you're down with this?
Which way did he go?
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
You think I'm a tourist?
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
What do you mean, "possessed?"
Yes...
..."The Devil?"...
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
Hey...
Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months?  What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
Where do you think we came from?
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
How did they get in here?
What other food?
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
Who invited you?
That was a great shot you made.
I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
Later.
And now?
About what?
Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.
You could have called me yourself.
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
And then you killed him, right?
Are you here to help me?
What're you going to do?
I wish I could help you.
If you did know, you'd tell me.
If you trusted me, you'd know.
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
Are you taking me to them?
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
Will you take me with you?
I'm afraid.
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
I hate outside! I hate it!
Don't!
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
We can't. We're going back.
Is it inside the city?
What kind of jewel is this?
We'll have to bury him.
Come with us.
But there may be a few around somewhere.
I'm sorry.
I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
You okay, man?
You're a musician?
I like to remember things my own way.
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
What's that, Ed?
I want more.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
Have you partied with him?
Set.
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
Alice...
I don't. I don't know him.
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
Repeat that, Bill.
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
That's not Fred Madison?
Yeah, Mack?
I wouldn't know how.
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
There's no other bedroom?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
Where's Alice?
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
That's why I married you.
Don't you want to watch it?
We've got to call the police.
Let's go home.
I told you to stay in the car!
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
At sixty?
You like pornos?
How ya doin', Pete?
Okay.
What's goin' on?
What are you guys doin'?
Why haven't you called me?
Last time I saw you.
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
What do you want?
Why don't you like me?
Where'd you come from?
I was?
I didn't know you cared.
Sheila...
Hey... Sheila.
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Sheila... Stop...
Cable from Gainsford.
Yes, sir.
I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
Uh-huh.
Yes, it just shows  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
Yes.
He might have lost his way.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
Yes.
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
If you want me to!
Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
You mean you don't want to go?
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
Where is your mad pilot?
And the wine - excellent.
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including  the excess of virtue itself.
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
buy and sell?
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
When was all this?
He amputated his own leg?
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Charming, isn't she?
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
Please let me help you.
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
Are you taking me?
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago  you're still alive, Father Perrault!
Sondra Bizet.
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
And be sure that none of the natives get in.
All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
Oh, stop it!
Hello, George.  Cigarette?
I don't know.
Uh-huh.
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
Porters?
What about the porters?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
What's she got to do with it?
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.
Where did you come from?
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
I guess we're in for it.
What do you suggest?
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?
Was this your idea?
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
Ouch!
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
How about you? Do you want to go?
EXCUSE ME
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
The hell happened?
You shot an eight year old girl.
...touch that.
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way.  Understand?
Bull... loney- Sir.  I'm sorry.  Sir, I'm sorry. Sir.  I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you.  I mean, everything here comes from you.
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
Mikey.  Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me.  Mikey.  I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey   Gimme the 140.
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
It's a bug.
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
Ha ha.  No, really.
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
Looks like a train ticket.
The radio show?
Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
Since how long?
in case I need it?
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
So... how'd you hear about this?
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
When?
What the hell does that mean?
Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Goodwill...
Nowhere.
So... now what?  Cattle call again?
I know what this is.    Zed, you in?
Did he say where?
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.
Kay?  What's your 20?
And they're buying it?
Actually, I don't know...
Wally!
What?
Agatha --
Drop some money.
Please, I want to go back...
Where are we going?
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
John?  What is it?
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
That's not much.
You don't remember me, do you?
From where?  D.C.?
You set your patients on fire!
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
Hence the expression...
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
Can you fake the cerebral output?
John.  Please.  Listen to me --
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
You don't have to do this, Chief.
Uh-huh.  Jad?
Red Ball?
Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
But you call this room the "temple".
She was looking right at me.
Just go to the beginning!
She's a precog?
Oh, Sean --
Sean --
I was looking for you...
I wanted to.
Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
Something wrong?
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
Heal who?
It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
This is all my fault.
I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
It's insanity around here.
The guy from USA Today is here.
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
Lamar, I found something.
I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
Good God.  What was that?
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
What?
Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
Can't they shut that off?
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
Raincheck?
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
I don't have any sugar either.
No.
That was our apartment.
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
You sure? I just made it.
Are you sure?
All the suites are about the same.
As far as...?
Women?
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
Should I fuck him?
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
You're not my daddy.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
I'll support you.
Goodbye, Bobby.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
But what about them?
Your dance is over.
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
What's that?
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
Heard of them.
Where's Ricky?
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
A million. Easy.
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
I got a way we make everybody happy.
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
Yeah. Sure.
Yes.
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
A bad heart.
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
No. Just the cross streets.
I can wait around if you want.
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
How am I being shitty?
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
Ask if he said anything to her.
I'll page you with the number.
Fuck them.
Come on, man. Not with the owners here.
I think we might.
We look good this year.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
How'd they know who you were?
This is bullshit, man.
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
You know this guy?
Yeah. What vibe?
Yeah.
You happy?
Nothing, man.
Float me a hundred bucks.
What about it?
I'm sorry...
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
No. I'll wait here.
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
I want to leave right now.
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
Did you see that shit? Motherfucker.  You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?
Yes?
How much is what?
Yes?
Yes.
How do you know it's not drugs?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
Stop.
Ow, shit...
I'm half Irish.
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
You know my pager number?
Yeah.
I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
I am.
I'm working trains. Selling.
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
When?
You looking good, Little. Real clean. Clean as the Board of Health. But you missing something.
It hit?
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
Shit, what else she gonna say?
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
Who the hell are you?
Man, what do you want?
What did you give it to me for then?
Putting all that poison in your hair.
Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.
What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
I don't know what to say to Allah.
Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
I don't know how.
Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other.
What can I do for you?
Make it plain.
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
Let's talk about you for a change.
No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
I'm in Detroit.
Did you hear what I said?
It will be rough.
I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
Dear heart, where are you?
I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
Brother Earl.
Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
Just what are you saying?
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
Let him finish.
If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
"His greatest greatness."
And like a fool I believe it.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
Get out.
Another one?
Let me die then.
You the man.
You evil this morning.
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
Well, all right, then.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
Bang, bang. You're dead.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
They talked about me like
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
[Where are you coming from?]
A lot of people are looking for you.
[Who pays you?]
[What money?]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[Drive.]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[How much do you want?]
[Yes. Many times.]
Were you provided with a gun?
What is it?
Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
Where are you from, Creasy?
No.
Do you always sleep with him?
Well, it's a sort of wife.
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
Did you used to?
You're late.
What's so important in Los Angeles?
The blocks.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
You've done much of this work before?
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
Rosanna Guerrero.
Last night. Do you know something?
For an American she understands this country very well.
[You have the money.]
[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
I like him, Mom.
Bye, Mom.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
[Who's that?]
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
Hey, Herbie...
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
So what do you feel like doing tonight?
Yeah, she looks all right from here.
I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
Who?
Ah?
It pains that they should do this.
Marty.
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.
Marty...
No...
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
You got an elevator in this house?
Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
Don't worry about it.
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
He coming home right now.
Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
Tommy...
What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
You  must  open  me  up  again?
Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
What?
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
You got directions?
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?
Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
What's that?
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
When will he be able to write?
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
I have a tent to myself.
Wait a second...
I was just asking...
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
Radar!
What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
Look.
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
I don't feel anything.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
So what makes you think he'll play for us?
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
See you.
How did you get called that?
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
You're asking for somebody else?
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
You don't go after the local scrunch?
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
I have not understood what you means.
There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Good morning, Colonel.
Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letterand stick by it?
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Uh-huh . . .
Can I help you pack?
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
Did you write this?
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Better let me talk to him.
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
Devoted entirely to the interests of all the John Does all over the country. Which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. He will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. A man whom he, personally, recommends. A great humanitarian; the best friend the John Does have.
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
That's good.
Oh.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
Looks all right
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulledthe Governor's starting a libel suitwhat's more, they all know John Doe's a phoneyand they insist on seeing him.
What's the idea?
Have you seen him?
Ann! Say, why didn't yuh
What do they want?
Help yourself.
I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy
And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
How could he be a fake? 
A what?
It makes no difference, Bertthe ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
Now, that's all right, isn't it?
Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
I want it as soon as possible.
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut andI'll eat him.
What are you doing up here then?
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
Yes! I was paid! But the
It's for Ann . . .
She isn't?
Oh!
Racket? What do you mean?
Say, who's putting up this dough?
Have you got the speech I gave you?
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
They're not usually graduate students.
Dinner's on you.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
Where did you find an old recording like that?
Could I please have a little water?
You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
Hi, Roper.
Anything on Korda so far?
What do you got on Korda?
Are you in charge, Roper?
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
How are we gonna get him out of there?
What's the first commandment?
You tell me.
What did you see?
They need to run first and second?
Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?
Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
I worship you.
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
Please. I'm begging you.
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
Yeah?
How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
Korda escaped.
Scott...
...the hell are you talking about?
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
I can't do that.
Roper...
Any verification on numbers.
System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
Why?
Why --
Your life that bad?
Do you believe in miracles?
Who are you?!
It's all here...
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  Redwood forests.  Oceans. Mountains --
How long?
Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
He had access to the keys --
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
Corporate fingerprints all over it.
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
What is it?
Then you had her killed.
Insurance?
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
You went to my high-school?
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
Voice activate.
Program name?
Transmit copy of program via satellite north uplink.
He's on us!!
Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all?
Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late.
SABER TOOTH TIGER!
Let's teach these vermin a few manners.
I see... a fox
Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
Let's go after him!!
I'm in!
And how do we do that?
It's... an eagle?
Hey, boss!
I'm outta here.
Simon says...
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
"Basically".
Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!
I am the mighty ape!
We're asking you to go to prison.
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
Boo-Boo.
What do you mean?
Shane was a friend of yours?
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
The deal's too good, Frankie
A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
Something came up.
Same here.
So you all make the same mistakes?
Meyer.
I been thinkin'...
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.
You boys carryin' pieces?
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
Strategy.
Where's the stiff?
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
What a cozy little scene.
You're fuckin' crazy.
Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
"4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet."
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
Oh my God...you're proposing?
I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
I'm reportin' this to my union!!
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
I'm so dumb! I <u>deserve</u> to die -
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
Where'd he go??
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
So, what do you think?
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
Well, they were right out in plain view.
What's wrong?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.
And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
Tell me why!
What's this, Diz?
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
What! Who?
You play--left field.
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
What!
Sam Foley--dead!
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
Are you ready for him, Bill?
Yes, yes--tell them I'll see them immediately--immediately!  I can't hold them off! They want something to say about this appointment. Ten to one they've got a man.
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
We can't help *what* they were! Forget 'em!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you--
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
Uh--Senator--I thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments.
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
I will, sir! I will!  I--I don't know how to thank you. I knew, if any man could help me--
Mr. President--
I have no defense against forged papers and--
Mr. President--
Please, sir!--come with me!
Oh, now--
Is--is something the matter?
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
Go ahead--punch.
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
I see. *This* one is so simple--
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
Have you always had to--work?
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
I've got more. You better tell me.
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
What do they--? Who are all those--?
Already? All these letters?
I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
Hello.
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
Ah! That's more like it! What?
I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father?
Order, gentlemen!
Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*.
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
Marvelous! And what would this camp set the Government back?
Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
Joe--drop everything and come with me!
--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
What do you want, Senator?
Well--me, too!
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
Jim!
You can't say *that* to--
Anything *better* to offer?
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
His first 'whiff'!
Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
Most every day.
They think he's pixilated.
Pixilated.
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
No. Are you?
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
Were you present when all these things took place?
You fainted.
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
What?
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
There's Times Square.
Here's a nice place.
You said I was a lady in distress.
I've often thought about going back.
Yeah, I know.
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
Yes, if it isn't too late.
Ready?
Mary, I'm going home.
Hello, Mary?
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
The guy's balmy.
With pay!
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is
Yes, but you said
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
Your Honor, I object.
That's pretty.
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
I can't find him.
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie
Are your parents living?
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
Why not? Who is he?
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
No, I'm his housekeeper.
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
I've got one for Cobb
Have a drink?
Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
Why, it's an artistic institution
The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Yes, sir.
Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
No - I don't want it, thank you.
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
Your Honor
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
Uh-huh.
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.
South Dakota - north?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
What do you think you're doing?
Twenty! What did he do with them?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
Hey, did you hear that?
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
What an asshole!
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand, Ernest. Did I miss something?
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
Why not?
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
I was... never satisfied.
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
That's a lot of people all at once.
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
And the Brocketts?
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
What's happening here?
Wow. You're something.
No.
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
What would you do?
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Sore throat?
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
You're doing great.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
So whose route is this?
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
And this is legitimate therapy?
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
Transference!
I guess you saw the show...?
We're only talking about six weeks.
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
In maybe three or four issues.
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
She's probably ten years older than you.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Amazing.
Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
Slash what?
A doll?
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
Sounds like you have several.
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
"Get to know your therapist."
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
Psych major?
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Sorry...
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
That was a terrible thing.
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
And what ritual would that be?
Oh yes, of course.
Altar boys?
The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble.
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
Goin' somewhere?
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
The sun turning black.
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
No women allowed.
Fifty percent.
So who's the broad?
No?
Yeah, I was there.
Yes.
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
You know your history.
Can you swim?
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
Something like that.
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
Why would I do that?
Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
You called me your girl?
Jonathan?
I'm your sister.
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
Juicy?
Tough break.
Who's here!?
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
I knew you'd know.
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
I thought you were done?
Do I?
Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.
We didn't think this through very well.
Atta, girl!
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --
Mon Captain, it's for you. 
He'll never make it.
That boy's got talent.
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
And the light goes out...
Or talk?
Sure.
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
What's your real name?
At the Frankenstein Center.
I'm going inside.
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
Bye. 
You're the Sphinx.
You drink too much.
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
Oh don't start that again --
Have you ever seen him?
You sure that's how you spell it?
There's just not enough of us.
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
Why not?
Or flowers.
The Obliterators!
Yes, Obie-wan.
You guys going to a costume party?
Here you go. 
Jeffrey!
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
This is bad.
And a social life.
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
That was too close.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat.  But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia.
What do you mean?
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked.  The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men.  Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.
I don't know, sire.
Who is there?
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Was the trip normal in every respect?
Ah-hh, no.
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
Does your mother know you have come?
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Oh...?
But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...
Thank you.
Good evening, sir.
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
What's your name?
Only Lisette?
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.
No... nothing at all.
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
Ah, that is good.
Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?
Were any of them married?
Promise.
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
Separate bedrooms?
Who is it?
I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles?  I asked for it yesterday.
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
You wrote it.
What was there to tell?
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
Do you like music?
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
Those are extremely harsh terms.
Has Alexander agreed to this?
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
Is he alone?
Come in.
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
Okay, I know what I want this time.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
It's cool, but where's the water?
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
Me, too.  You think they're in there?
What you mean talk to her?
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
Who is that?
This you?
You straight?
What?
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
I ain't trying to get in it.
Thanks a lot, Craig.
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
You want us to give you a ride?
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
What's the matter?
That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.
What it smell like?
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
That the big one, huh?
What was that?
I do.
Roach, what are you doing?
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
Roach...Roach, come on.
Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Tape his mouth shut.
Where did Craig move to?
Debo!  Debo!
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
My back.
All right, I'll do it.
Amtrack?
Somebody close?
She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
I appreciate that.
You're out of your mind.
You get another chance in ten minutes.
What...?
He's dead?
I kill her - and you kill me.
How am I supposed to get away?
Again.
Are you sure?
But...
We have to hurry.
Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
Ready?
He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
Can we go now?
Then why'd you drag me into it?
Meet Irene.
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
Fuckin' A.
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
I'm not a baby.
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
Get moving.
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
I'm looking for them.
You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
And what happens if I don't call you?
You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead.  Do it.
That's enough.
Ain't seen you in a coon's age, Johnny.
Leavin', boy?
Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle Birdie.
Do you mind me cussin', boy?
Yes! Yes!
What can we do, Mother?
Lynch him! Lynch him!
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
I must wend my way down River on the Lord's work.
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
You, Pearl. You swear too.
Why?
It's all here.
Where are we goin', John?
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
Don't you hurt her!
John, where's your folks?
I'll see to Pearl.
Did you hear what I said, son?
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
What are you doing, boy?
What's taking you so long about it?
Now: Where?
Nothin'. 
O no! Your turn!
About our secrets.
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
What's wrong, John?
I been bad!
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
He never asked me for nothin'.
Okay, good. She's asleep.
Oh my god, oh my god...
So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
What the hell's going on!?
You okay?
Jesus, it's dark in here.
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
What happens if they don't do that?
Bring him out of what?
Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
You crazy? Hit him with what?
Meanwhile...?
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
What's the Coroner got to say?
Maybe god's punishing us all...
Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
Did you sleep?
Right home after.
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
Guess I should'n'a done it.
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
I never touched her.
No.
Rod says the sweetest things.
Good evening, Anna.
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
And you too, Ninotchka.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
Yes.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
Are we free, Buljanoff?
That's her.
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
Capitalistic methods...
He's cutting our throat...
We don't like Razinin.
Misha! Misha!
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
What a lovely room you have here.
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
Good morning, Your Highness.
A blue shirt, perhaps?
I guess it is eight forty-two.
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? A maid comes in -- a French maid.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
If you want to see us you must come later.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
Bad news?
This is Comrade Kopalski.
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
If there is anything we can do for you...
How are you, you three scoundrels?
That's two weeks from Thursday...
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
Yes!
Yes. Could you give me some information?
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
Yes, it is.
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
Then you don't want me to go there.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
Is that customary?
I will start with you.
That is correct.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
Do you hear that?
Oh, let it ring.
Then do it through my lawyer!
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
You see? Life can be so simple.
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
No... go on.
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
Comrades! Comrades!
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
Not white, darling.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
Radio! What is radio?
Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.
Did you win?
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
Did I hear something about jewels?
This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!
What did he say?
Thank you.
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
All right, I'll listen.
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
Good morning.
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
May I have your bags, madame?
Well... that's my business, madame.
Good morning, Comrade.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
Cigarette?
I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
You want me to go to Constantinople?
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
How's the job coming, Bob?
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
Hunt has nothing to lose now.  Pardon all of them.  Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned.
How much do you need?
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking.  He's the one ...
Why me?
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Pay him.
This is not a joke, John!
Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over.  These aren't fraternity pranks, John.  It's anarchy.  A revolution!
We can't touch Hoover --
No, you didn't, Bob.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts.
Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
About a dozen.
... an action that will at last, once and for all, show that what I knew and what I did with regard to the Watergate break-in and cover-up were just as I have described them to you from the very beginning ...
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
Their fourth!
He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
Just do what I say, Bob.
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
Where are they?
Sir?
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
Mr. President!
Congratulations, boss.  A great victory!  The madman theory wasn't so crazy after all.
So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ...
You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
Current levels may not be sufficient.
And me? ...
Oh, my goodness ...
Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
There must be a quarter-million out there, Edgar.  They've been at it now for a year.  Young kids just like Tricia.  I don't know.  Do you think they have a point, Edgar?  Maybe this whole damned system of government is ...
Who do you think is behind it?
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
How the fuck did you know?
Where'd you find him?
Mein Kampf?
It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists.  "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.
Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ...
... as the old alliances crumble.
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
If they harass you, I, too, will resign.  And I will tell the world why.
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can I get you?
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics.
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...
It was illegal, what he did.
Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy.
Jesus Christ!
... give me a break, Mary.
But it was all we had.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
Proud?
Of them.
Don't you want to listen to Brown's victory speech?
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
I'll do it.  No more.
Anything.
Because ... I have to relax.
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
Won or lost?
What?
How'd you know I was here.
You heard it?
What would you a done if he'd been released?
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
Nineteen zero and nine.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
Hard to believe.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
Yes ma'am?
You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
...You ride Winston.
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
That's the boy.
We goin' in?
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.
Yes Noreen you better had. Thank you.
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
Yessir.
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
I got it Mama.
No.
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
Did you buy that gun?
You can't afford one?
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
I know where the money is.
And where is that.
...Where's the transponder?
...You getting anything on this?
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
How much?
Well... I need to close now --
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
Call it.
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
You already have the tent?
I'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
It's all right.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
Could I get another room.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
Waitin' for my wife.
...But that won't last.
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
I don't mean braze.
Were you in Nam?
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
Any idea where it is?
Great. Good. Content...
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
What?
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
Why do they keep calling you George?
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
Of course.
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
Oh. Of course... sorry.
George...
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
Where you headed, Betty?
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
How did you know?
Worse.
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
She called you 'George,' George.
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
The Five?
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
Looking for someone?
Are you sure I can borrow this?
What are you doing?
What?! That you had something to do with it?
Huh?
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
I hope you're right...
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.
How'd they describe her?
So you believed the bartender. Why?
I said 'got it?'
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
This is Betty at twelve.
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
Can I have an evil twin?
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
Did Chloe crack?
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
Huh?!
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
What sat mean exactly, Everett?
A miracle! It was a miracle!
What's his name again?
Suckin' away.
Devil his due.
Ass right.
No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
Where's your ring, honey?
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
All's well that ends well, as the poet says.
Yes, but honey -
Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.
It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
Fact of the matter - there never was!
But...
Well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-
Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
Who's the honcho around here?
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.
It was a powerful air.
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
Come back here, kid!
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
Great ass.
I knew you'd make it!  Where's your girl? Didn't she come?
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
Zack, we've got to go.
Joe!
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?
Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
Vietnam?
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  So how late are you, Lynette?
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
How did it go with you guys?
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
Yeah? Why're you here?
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
I don't want you to move.
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
You okay?
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
What?
There is not one thing funny here.
So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out.
Two.  Squeeze harder.
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
Fuck.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
Be quiet.
They're coughing.
Yeah?
May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.
Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!
Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
Makes me nervous.
Ever read any Poe?
Too many stairs.
Shoulda got an apartment.
Can't hear a thing.
What do we do?
I heard you.
What are you doing?
Why?
Tyrone...
I'm okay... listen to me...  Let's go with Judge, check it out.
No...
Lemme see that rifle son...
For the last time Boy!!! What do those guns mean??!!
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
Get out of the car.
Inspector Brimmer
Hey... what the hell you doing?
Hey... Cy... what now you a righteous Panther man, you too uppity to drink with us?
Hey, this what they got you doing now?
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
You want me to put a man on it?
Rodgers... this is no good...
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
Yes sir I was.
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns.
C'mon let's...
Huey man I got to talk with you...
Yeah man, but where's Judge?
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous.
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
Sorry man...
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
We'll all get out of here together.
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
You believe that?
Congratulations.
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
What do you mean, old and ugly?
You got salt last week.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
How can we end this madness?
Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.
The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.
Have you seen any Redcoats?
Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.
And, Corporal...  ... be careful.
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
No, I don't.
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
That's why it was four years between you and Thomas.  It took me that long to regain her respect.
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.
You don't hate him.
Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
You were an Englishman then...
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.
We saw.
Goodbye, Francis.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
Gray.
Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis.
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
It's gorgeous!
There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
But--
What say, Louis?
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
It's funny, all right.
Almost there, Louis.
Can I have another one?
A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
Let her go. It's cool.
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
You better get going, hon.
You stole my boat.
My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
How does he do that?
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
We got that part.  Anything else?
Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever.  I think you're a fool.  A mortal fool.
Now?
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
Maid or not, it fits you.
Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
You're speaking up for him again?
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
Miss Swann.
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
That was before I met one, of course.
Why?
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
Raise the sails.
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
You cheated.
Because you're a pirate.
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
I can get you out of here.
Agreed.
Why are brothering with that?
It's still against the law.
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
Wait -- what about the pistol?
What's that?
On what?
Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
Jack!
You've seen it?
You haven't seen it.
He may be.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
How long do you leave him in there?
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
You can't mean that.
This is our world, Susan, and once you realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven.  Science is the quest for divine perfection.
What are you going to do to him?
What did you use?
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
You know how I feel about you.  You know how much I need you.  How much I trust you.  I would do anything for you.
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back --
It'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  The gardener will know what to do.
Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?
What is it with you litterbugs?  Is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?
I don't believe this is happening...
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
Sir, please try to hold still.
Somebody has to.
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.
... just like the mouse.
You don't know?
That was an egg?
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
What's wrong?
I could go with you.
That's pretty good.
Argon's private lab.
You saved my life.
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal.  Do you remember that?
All the different ways that I could kill you.
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
Exactly.
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
That's considerate of you.
Oh, Mother!
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
No? What do you look upon her as?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
Anne, come here. Listen
Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Why not?
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
What play?
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
Did you take anything out of those pants?
That's a canary, sir.
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
The boss is getting hoarse.
Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
My mistake - she's glaring.
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?
Hey, Gallagher!
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
No.
A statement? Good.
Well, at best you might deny it.
I don't eat waffles.
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
Good morning, everybody  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
Heavens! The man's insane!
Well done, sir. Very neat.
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Yes.
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
Can I ask you a question?
You sure you want to know this?
Does it look okay?
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
Where'd you get this?
No she's not.
Wait ...
It's alright. Let me see.
You can't go out there.
Like a drum.
I told you where I was.
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
But where would we go?
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
... Why?
Oh God! Are we in that episode?
But it could happen.
Want some bridge mix?
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
Are you alright?  What is it?
What happened?
Did you do this?
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
Dan! Arrest them!
How'd you know about the fire?
"It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."
What are you doing?
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
Pleasantville Marathon?
Oh God.
I don't believe this.
No way.
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
Me too. Sounds swell.
So what is it?
No. She really liked you.
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
How come I'm still in black and white?
This thing works. We could go home right now.
Keeps going ...
Hi.
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
Yeah ...
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
Why would I do that?
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
WAIT A MINUTE!!
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
I had nothing to do with that.
Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ...
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Have you cooked the burgers?
Oh hi!
Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
Well don't you?
Really?
It's an art book.
TV repair.
Yeah. TV busted?
Oh GOD ...
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
...please, I just don't want it....
It's not cool?
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
Are you gonna do it?
Goodbye.
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
No she didn't; that's a lie.
Tell me why.
Hello, this is Back.
Hi. This is Jack.
Where are you?
No.
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
You have trouble, financial trouble?
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
Why did you tell me you did, then?
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
There's a piano in the street.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Do you have brothers or sisters?
Oh My God.
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
Do you want to pick me up?
You like her?
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
Yeah.
This is Barry.
Have a good trip.
It's so nice.
That's right you travel so much.
Yeah.
Yes I'm sorry.
Lena I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital..... I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage?
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
Yeah.
I don't know.
What do you mean?
No one will know your name.
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
Now are you threatening me, dick?
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
How many sisters do you have?
How's business?
Yeah.
...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?
Why you wearin' a suit?
Good morning, Barry....
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE! MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN TOLEDO.
What happened?
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
Yes.
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
Yes I am.
I know.
I know.
It's ok. That's alright.
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
Marquis? Is that you?
Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
They can't be serious.
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
Go to hell!
Who's to say I did not?
NEVER!
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
You have to believe me, I had no idea --
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself --
Well?
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
It was fiction, of course.
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
Here it is; the last chapter.
The peril of composing such incendiary prose...
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
"...your wife."
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
I am eternally in your debt.
You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
I see. And you are in California for what reason?
Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
How bad is it?
This picture--
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
There's a different between want and
He lied to me
I want blood
Keep filming.
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
What are movies about, Orson?
Magic
Not for me.
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
Yes.
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight--
I'll hire you  -- right now-
It's 350 pages long.
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
Jesus Christ --
You gonna watch?
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
May I help you?
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
It came.
Very generous
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
Pardon?
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
Well it' s all you've got !
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
How 'bout a real drink?
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
Where you going at this hour?
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
What's wrong?
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
Answer me when I talk to you.
And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
Yeah --
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
With her? How?
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town?
Why didn't you tell me about it?
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
What do you mean, "you"?
What do you mean, "you"?
That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
Can you see it?
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
You said never to touch you before a fight.
Take off my pants.
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
You're not interested in him?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
I went out.
I called. You weren't there.
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you.
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
Jake --
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
This is the baby sitter.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
-- until yesterday morning.
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
For what?
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
Can you get me that ring back?
I predicted it.
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.
You're never going to marry?
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
Isn't he a salesman?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
What about this morning? Any developments?
I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
What are you two talking about?
Anything else bothering you?
Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
Make the one you want.
Yes.
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
That's what is know as "manless melancholia."
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
Lisa, please!
What are you getting at?
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
I have the whole weekend off.
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
I'll rephrase the question.
Well?
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag.  During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
L. B. Jefferies.
Nobody chickened.
What's happening?
Buzz Gundersen.
Any other entrance?
No.
Tell him why we moved here.
We don't have time.
Will you let him tell it!
Well, just get it off your chest, son.
I don't think so--
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
I was talking to Jim.
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
Where did you get the gun?
You shouldn't monkey with him.
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
You scared?
Are you really going to meet them?
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
What?
Isn't he schizoid?
I don't want you for my father!
Plato?
Why?
You sure?
No.
Who's that?
I shot at one of them.
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
What a zoo!
If he could--
Hi.  I saw you before.
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Yeah--why--
Goodbye!  See you!
You cold?
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
Ever been in a place like this before?
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
Plato, where's your father now?
What?
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
That one?
You weren't looking for company, were you?
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
How did you know that?
You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
-- till he fucked his parole --
Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...
You can't find... what?
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
No --
Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
You motherfucker.
You sold him out.
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
Get the hell off of me!
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
Get your own room, Ashley.
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
They'll have guns.
He wants to see your map.
He says he wants it now.
No.
You... you... YOU --
What?
No --
Put him in the truck.
But you were saying you were...
So you could get down her chimney.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
What the fuck are you talking about.
We walked the place for a week.
They won't recognize me.
A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
Do I get a country-western name?
You got one hour.
What'd you tell that casino manager?
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you.  Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six.
Can't be attracting attention, right?
Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
You gotta get someone upstairs.
Monsters in the gelatin...
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
Hell you haven't.
Three days, man.
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
Oh.
Don't move, Rudy!
Tell her... I'll be there ...
NO!!!
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
POP! That was My card!
That's what it looks like!
How ya doin', Toothpick?
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
I don't know, but somebody did.
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
The Brewers.
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
Didja use the commode story?
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
I know.
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
For what, the cops?
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said "No thank you", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!
I'm cool.
Want a smoke?
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
I got the diamonds.
I got 'em, all right?
Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
Why!
We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
Not these guys.
Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
This must have been in the family a long time.
So am I.
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
There's a nice boy.
Like what?
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.
We can't stay here!
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
Thanks for taking over.
How does she draw?
Who's Lednov?
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
Go on, hit me.
I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
I can't take her with me.
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
Go away -- please.
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
That sure smells good.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
I figure we'll get along just fine.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
Goodbye and thanks.
You think that's all we busted -- You should see...
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
You're not giving up?
Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.
He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
Good night, Miss Wells.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
What comes after Z?
Then I know my alphabet.
And that's tough, isn't it?
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
How about California?
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'.
She was only teasin'.
Are you okay?
Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
My favorite memory was when we --
Really? That's amazing.
Help!
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
Shhh... It's okay.
So, I guess I can go now.
Ray, run faster.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
Buddy...
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
He's here.
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Better try a little higher.
Cindy, let me...
Look, what I'm trying to say --
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
Hey, look out, a bee!
Are you okay?
No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
How about these buns?
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
Stop! --
Both of them?
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
Father!
I'm sorry.
So, do you think you made it into the class?
Yo! That jacket is tight.
That was a great idea, Shorty.
Did you do that?
Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
I take it you're not mad at me.
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
Would you please focus?
The image there.
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
I can do it myself.
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.
You never could feel your legs.
A little bit... Give me your belt.
Father.
Father, I think you should rest.
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
No comment!
Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
You've been working in that video shop too long.
Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults.
No woman would!
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
You bring me such peace...
Don't wake the kids...
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
Hello.
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
Who is this?
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
He killed people, Mom.
Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
Mrs... Sutphin?
Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
Certainly not!
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
What was that?
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
You scared?
Let's get out of here.
When I wanted to.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
How much does she want?
I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you - had your picture in her office.
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village -	"The Dante."
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
What did she want to know?
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
The people at the restaurant?
Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
But I'm not joking.
Well?
I'm tired of being afraid - of waiting.
I have been at the library.
I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
I had begun to write again -that's whet I was doing when you came in.
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.
I hate people who try to peddle comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. It's better this way.
Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one  so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her - he doesn't make her laugh  he just sits and talks.
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books are on the closed shelf. You have to get permission.
What was she to you?
Wait - there is that other favor.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
Dr. Judd?
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
Would they hurt her?
I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
Yes.
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.
Graham is an unusual name.
No, I think you look... fine.
Oh, uh-huh.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
Mother, father, sister.
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people, so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with.
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
What?
Of course not.
It's a personal project I'm working on.
What... what are these interviews about?
About sex?
Tell me your name.
Tell me your name.
Yes.
I guess not.
Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff, and I hate that, I don't want to be like her, I don't want to be like her!!
About who?
Why not?
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
And you feel the same way with John?
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
But that was part of it?
Like maybe a big part?
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
Yes. I just got busy.
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Why?
You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't.
Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?
Goddam right.
You son of a bitch!!
Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
What upsets you about that?
Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
What do you mean?
No, he left last week.
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
I say it because it's descriptive.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
What are you talking about?
And what?
I just thought it might --
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
Because I never got around to it.
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
Yes, I did.
He wouldn't do that.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
You couldn't do it, period.
Here it is.
Thank you.
Bye.
No, I touched me.
I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
Do I sit or stand?
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Hello.
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
Hello.
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
Not for three-fifty.
Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
Mr. Millaney?
He said immediately.
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
Is that the man who called you up here?
Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.
I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
You put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say it's crazy.
Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely.  All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
Yeah? What do I do then?
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
You bet, Bert.
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
About Brad's family?
You got it!
I know, I know, it's just...
SIN-I-FUL
Why Janet?
SPONSOR!!!
With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
I'll leave you young things to it.
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
I'd forgotten.
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
No!  He's never done that before.
. . .For his own good.
Brad!
F for...
F for...
That's an extremely negative response.
YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
Isn't she lovely?
It's Christine.  Hey you.
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
You okay, Miles?
Two years ago, buddy.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
Great. You look great.  You both do.
Anything I'd know?
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
This is rose, right?
How would you rate this one?
You know, you could work in a wine store.
We should have driven.
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
It does. Feels right.
Yeah. Tight.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
Sure I know Maya.
Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
Have you no shame?
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
We're on.
So what should I wear?
Where were you?
Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
Later.
What'd Christine say?
Besides what?
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
What is it?
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
Is it the money thing?
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
Let me use your phone.
What's that supposed to mean?
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
Yep. Quite a day.
Want me to drive?
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
Come on, let me drive.
You broke some.
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
Is she sleeping or...?
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Okay. See you around.
Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading at any time. I'll take no offense.
I had class.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
Oh, Maya. No.
Victoria! How the hell are you?
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Where are you?
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
Where's Jack?
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
Daddy.
I think it's contaminated.
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
I don't want you to die.
...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
I see.
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
No I'm not.
It was very dark.
Do you think it's a possibility?
Chicken Teriyaki.
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
Merrill!
I can feel air.
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
I don't think so.
Is he okay?
Is that him?
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.
Looks like those boys are headed south, so they weren't the same ones that jumped me. Which way you going?
You own this land.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
This a friend of yours?
Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
Hello, Cobb.
I see you're prospering without me.
Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
I never could count on you to be reasonable.  Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
You work here?
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
Where's the dog now?
What is it that I can't figure?
Some people think because they're stronger -- or meaner -- they can push you around. I've seen a lot of that. But it's only true if you let it be. The world is what you make of it.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
Hair and make-up?
Even the fall from the plane?
As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
Really?
-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?
I just read somewhere --
I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
Hello?
Thank Simone for the tickets.
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
What I do to Simone?
Simone?
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
-- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
How will you do our love scenes?
Hal, what are you doing?
You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
Your mother couldn't make it?
Not quite how I imagined it --
Me too.
You know, I... don't know.
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
-- I know, I don't know anything.
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
Why didn't she thank you?
Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?
Do I know you?
So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
Mr. Sayer...
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
Let's take it down a notch.
A star is...
You mean they buy it?
You did create me.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
Goodnight, Malcolm.
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
No.
Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--
I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
--What?
Dr. Crowe?
Are you wigging out?
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
What are you thinking, Momma?
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
You know that accident up there?
A lady. She died.
Where is she?
Cole, you're scaring me.
What are you thinking, Momma?
She wanted me to tell you--
I don't know how else to look--
What--
How did you--?
...He doesn't get invited places.
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
Get off his case sweetie.
Fuck you.
Witch.
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
Suzie???
Looks like the alternator.
Dammit, Carl!!!!
Hey. Fuck you.
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
Curt Cobain.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
Should we be doing this, dude?
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
Sure. What do you want to know.
It's time to make amends.
Throw me one.
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
Chicken sandwich?
Shit!
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
What are --
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
Like your guitar break.
-- Where have you two been?
And that makes you look like a squid?
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
What you up to?
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
How about Brenda?
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
No reception out here.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
What are you doing?!
Where are you?!
He's a fucking Martian?!
Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
Rorschach.
Looks like a chipmunk.
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
Are you nodding?
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
Flip.
Where are you going?
That's not true -- Where are you--?
Welcome home.
I'll get if for you.
I loved you. I loved --
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
Get your hands off my daughter!
You got my barley pop?
Why're you driving so fast?
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
An existentialist.
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
Well?
Jesus!!!
See ya, Kate.
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
What kind of a guy is he?
What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
Why are we doing this?
Liquid gold.
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
Talk to me.
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
This is Bandit I. Over.
Shut up, Fred.
Is that Bandit in the lead?
Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Anything on the Swede?
So he has no idea what's about to happen?
He's giving them up?
He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
Really?
-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
What'd you say?
I could have it sent out...
Do you want me to say I did it?
I am. Yeah.
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
...Does he know?
...When did you know all this?
...Yeah, fifty-three.
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
No shit.
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
Why?
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
What'd you say?
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
And so I get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?
No?  Who am I, then?
What happened to Gibarian?
Where's his body?
No.  There's no behavior modification.
You murdered her!
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
What will you say?
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
They come when you sleep.
What do you want?
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
When did this happen?
I need to see Snow.
I wasn't.
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
You're better when you take them.
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
Where've you been?
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
He has a point.
Do I really feel like... I am...?
What are you talking about?
But we fought.
Why did she do it?
Can you sleep?
You're the coward.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
I think they help.
What does it want?
I've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God.  Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it.  It's created a situation without a goal, and I hate that.  A God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.  And us?  We would have to have "an arrangement".  An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How can I not hate something that does that?
How can you be here...
Snow, get up here, now.
Occasionally.
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
I'm supposed to call in.
People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.
Let's get a drink.
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
You were reading my Renoir.
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
Yeah.
Good night, Mike.
You put me life in danger.
You told her?
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
Are you okay?
Where?
What a memory.
They guys treatin' you all right?
I'll miss you, Mike.
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
Mike?
My ass is falling.  It is.
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
What shit, honey?
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
Bought it.
What did she say the down payment was?
What was that?
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
Are you in charge here?
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
You should'a brought the girl.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
Under the table.
How about dinner tonight?
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
Shooting.
Sexual tension...
Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
Peter-- you took this picture?
What, want a glass?
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
Flash, drop it--
Flash, get lost.
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
How are you doing, kid?
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
Yeah--
Can't focus...
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
You're making my life difficult.
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
Sit down and stop being such a child.
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
I... I like you.  A lot.
Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
Of course.
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
I'll introduce you.
I'm a photographer, remember?
Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
Absolutely no class.
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
Why? It is a wrestling match, or
Where'd you get the clown suit?
He'll try to finish his experiment.
What's wrong with him?
Jawohl!
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
What some brandy?
105-353.
I'm okay here. Why bother?
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
What is this? This is water?
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
Let me go! Let me go!
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
You'll fix me up!
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
That's what I wanna hear.
Do Grable.
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
Let me do it, Hoffy.
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
What about Schulz?
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
What radio?
Stay out of it, Sefton.
Lay off, Sefton.
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
What are we going to do with him?
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
I'll kill you for that!
December seventh, forty-one.
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
Good morning, Sefton.
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
What guy?
I do not want those cigarettes.
You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
That is my wife.
You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
Have a nice time over there?
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
Are any of them inhabited?
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
We're within range, sir.
Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
Left behind?
Can I?
I don't understand.
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
Close to retirement?
How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III?
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
But I do have a theory...
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
Kirk here.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
Counselor. What can I do for you?
Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
The royal...studs?
One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
Mr. Chekov -- ?
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
Response?
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
Hello, sir. It's David.
It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Same sector. Metallic mass.
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
My readings indicate great instability.
Why?
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
This planet is aging in surges.
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
Captain, what's happening?!
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
Mr. Scott?
Good shooting, Scotty.
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
I know you... Do I not?
Yes, yes, Spock...
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
The word, sir?
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in!
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
I -- saw no future --
Then, how --
... The needs of the many outweigh...
... Or the one.
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
Bones!...
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
Firing range, sir.
500 Kellicams!
You amaze me, Commander.
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
Khan could be down there!
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
But what if they went -- nowhere?
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
I don't mean to intrude.
It was just words.
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
Well?
Departing dark side, Regula.
Tactical!
-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system.
On screen.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
Is the word given?
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
It literally is Genesis...
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
That's it?
Uh oh.
Spock!
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
Yes.
Reliant's command...
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
Time!
I really must thank you.
May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone --
We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
Fire all phasers...!
He's not what I expected, Sir.
I do not understand the final question...
The question is irrelevant.
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
Heard there was some excitement.
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
Now wait just a damn minute.
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
What did you say she was getting?
Wake up, man, wake up!
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
You're joking...!
10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
How long?
No choice now, Scotty!
Status report, Admiral!
You sure you won't change your mind?
Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
All right. Who are you? and don't jerk me around any more. I want to know how you know that.
Or believe, I'll bet.
Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.
Do you trust me?
You're upset about losing the whales.
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
I'm all ears.
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
So. There we are.
It's true... what you said...
Steady, now. We need your help.
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
... Gone?!
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
... What does that mean?
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Hey! -- Where you going?!
You mean this is -- goodbye?
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
Mr. Spock, your computations?
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Status?
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
10 seconds, sir!
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
Bearing!
We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
Admiral! There be whales here!
You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
Right on. You fly?
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
There are days.
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
Will it?
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
Jak'tahla?
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
Do machines ever play?
No... I want to stay with you...
You either need a new uniform or a new neck.
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Yes... that looks like them.
A ship,
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
I'll order Riker to turn around.
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
They're powering their forward weapons array.
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.
Scanners are off line!
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
You need a haircut, Commander.
... Population three hundred million...
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
Come in.  Hi.
Why don't you try sitting up?
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Montana.  Energize.
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
Dispersive armor is holding.
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
Data... are you sure you're all right?
Juice?
Where?
What did you do to the batteries?
This must be it.
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
Captain --
No... the door's too thick.
The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
Captain, the Enterprise!
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
Main bus...
Jean-Luc Picard.
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
"Money." So you can get dome money...
What?
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
Friends from Cornell...
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
Why?
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
Track their weapons fire.
Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
What the hell is happening, Worf?
What are they doing?
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
Report.
Someone...?
They're bypassing Engineering...
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
Worf to Bridge.
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
Spock, that was actually funny.
Figures.
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were spooning -
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
This is fun...
I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
"To be or not to be, that is the question" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
And what did they tell you?
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
Where is Mr. Sulu?
She's here - somewhere.
Course heading, Captain?
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
And your coat.
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
I always wanted to try that.
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
Surely not.
According to my information, today.
Me?
WE volunteered?
Captain...
The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
Are you dining on worms?
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?
I SHOULD have been -
Close enough to beam down?
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
That could take hours!
And if they're still in place?
They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
Why?
Indefinitely.
I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I dont show up for my physical on time!
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochrans own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
He is very observant.
Data!
My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
A weapon.
What do you imagine this is?
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
Ready, Captain.
How long until we reach the fleet?
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
How can you be sure?
You have a red shirt.
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment.  The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. Id say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data .
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
Yes.
What purpose does this serve?
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
How can you be certain?
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
No.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
It's working.
He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
Anything.
And you're not as we imagined you.
I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... youd be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
Were we always explorers?
In time, Jean Luc.
All of this so you could capture me?
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
My God...
Intruder alert!
Are we prepared?
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
What can I do for you folks?
I'll take that.
We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?
Recognize this?
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
Why did you let it get into a populated area?
I don't like it, George...
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
I just retired.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Please.
Dashboard.
What?
What?
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
Horses.
What?
When do you have to be here?
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
The captain...
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
Yes.
I will go. But not you.
I don't want you to be hurt.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
What?
Good morning.
You don't forget anything, do you?
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
How long will it take you to get home?
Where do you think you're going?
Help me!!
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
You sure this is your car?
I told you I'm looking for someone.
Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
You have no conception of this, do you?
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
Is there a reward in this?
Hello...
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
I made my choice, Lenny.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
Faith, call me, okay?
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
I understand.  No, I'm not.
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
What kind of things exactly?
You alright?  Y'okay?
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
So've I.  Too much.
Top ten.
Faith OK?
Whattya mean?
What stuff?
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
You just did.
So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
So lay it off to somebody else.
Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
I always do.
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
What's his name?
That would be no.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
What's that?  Present from Faith?
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?
How's Zander?
Whatup Lenny?
Lenny, give them the tape.
Shit!
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
Those two guys were cops.
Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
It was a tough call.
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
I guess.
You see Tran?
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
Are we under arrest?
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
Besides that.
Testa?
No.
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
What does the Manager say?
Dylan here.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
You... surprised me.
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
What did he look like?
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
You have the photo from the diner?
He said it was a clue?
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
How do you feel, Agent
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was "Imelda." Have to give him that, had a sense of humor.
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
Miss me, Dave?
None taken.
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
Don't even go there. What's up?
What about the chat rooms themselves?
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
Look at this fellow... or this one.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
There are Agency regulations about this.
He's called a couple times.
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
Maybe we should back off a bit.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
Then there's the other issue.
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
You were right. He found me.
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
Jaime --
Agent...
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
Suspect Zero?
I don't carry it with me.
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
Is he dead?
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
Thomas Mackelway.
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
"MyDick?"
I don't...
Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if...  Skipping message. End of final message.
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
Thanks.
Are you sure? Maybe...
To do what?
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
A couple of high rollers like you?
Huh?
Do you have anything smaller?
Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
Who's your booking agent?
Well, who represents you back east?
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
Me too.
I'll be around.
It's not going to well?
...Which one...?
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
I mean, I need the money.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
I didn't mention her once today.
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
You want to talk about it?
Uuuuugh!
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. 
Are you ready to order?
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
VEGAS.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
Cut that shit out.
That's not cool.
It doesn't matter...
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
...Well, you know, not counting the first table.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit.
What was the part?
She was hot.
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
...a day...
Selling scrap metal.
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
What time's this party tonight?
How you guys doing?
What are you doing?
We got the digits, baby.
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
Tomorrow?
Because he's a bitch.
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
Now?
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
...Anaheim...
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
...Sue...
...Shut up, Sue...
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
And you?
Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.
You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
Godfather!
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?
What was that?
The food is on the table.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
Outside.
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
No...how a man makes his living is none of my business.  But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed.
You take care of your family?
Is it necessary?
This morning.
It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
And this?
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
Things went badly in Palermo?
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
Hey, beautiful girls!
It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
Mike!  The party starting!
Is the hospital covered?
What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca.  That worries me.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
Was there a definite proposal?
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
I'm German-Irish.
Sure.  Anything I can do for you.
Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the job's worth.  Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
Mike, why am I out?
I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.
Michael, what are those men doing?
They're talking to themselves.
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You wouldn't like him.
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
Then Luca turned to the other man...
I LOVE YOU.
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
That's not how Pop would have played it.
Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
A million times.
Do you renounce Satan.
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.  Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Buy me out?...
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
You think I scam?
How do you do.
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
Okay.  And did we know each other?
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
You know, a primer.
I'm intruding.
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
I could fuck this icebox I love it so much.  What were you actually doing in New York?
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
I didn't mean with you in it.
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
Shoes too?
Freddie drove me back in his car.
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
I wanted to tell you my plan.
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
How?
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?  I'd pay you. I'd pay you 1000 dollars.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
That's a terrific idea.
Look at me what?
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
Marge? Where are you going?
I told you. He gave them to me.
How would you know that?
No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley.
Is this you?
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Dickie, my God!
Of course. Aunt Joan.
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
Will we see you later?
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
We'll be there.
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
How was it?
Or Tom and Peter even.
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
I really don't want to see anybody.
No!
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
Nah, this'll be fine.
You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?
Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
What did you do?
The moon?
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
What about the record?
Hello, Travis.
Travis?
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
What taxi driver?
Try holding the match like this.
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
No, I don't think so.  That's someone else.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
Where.
I have.
20 bucks?
That ain't much of a name.
That's a nice name.
Do they drug you?
Listen...
Do you understand why I came here?
But that one night?
Well, I tried.
Where?
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
Why should it be grounded?
No.
I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes.
No trouble with the Hack Bureau?
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
No, I want long shifts.
So I hear.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
Is that so?
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
Sure.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know?  I don't even know what you're talking about.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Could we change the subject?
Thank you.
Spit it out.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
What are you doing?
God's speed.
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow.
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
You first.
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
We were in love... weren't we?
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
Nine hundred...
Now, did you remember that, or...
What... do you remember?
Delly, shhhhhh...
Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...
Here we are.
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
Are you saying that he's...
"It's a Wonderful Life."
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
We've been closed for a while.
Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
You bet.
Well...
Why don't you two get out there and dance?
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.
What's wrong?
You kids off to the dance?
It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
You smell gas?
You think he's drunk somewhere?
Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?
You should watch what you say.
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President.  But it'll always be someone.  Count on it.
That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
Found me.
T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
It's about me.
What happened?
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
And what had you done?
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
And the second?
Yes.
Mother!
They haven't harmed anyone.
Miss Daniels?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
Do you know him?
Yes, but where?
See them two big trees across there?
And the white house?
The two kids?
Yes.
I need her exact name, you see.
Yes?
Thank you.
How much for the phone calls?
Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
How long have you known her?
She was selling birds.
Yes?
Well... well, is everyone all right?
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
Mitch...
I can handle it.
They won't be.
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
These birds were...
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
He was killed last night. By birds.
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
He's not home.
Well... yes, sir, there are.
How?
I think you're a louse.
What's that?
Ouch!
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
You like me, huh?
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
What?
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
Why?
Do you expect me to believe...?
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
Of birds?
It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
No, no...
The town looks clear.
I keep thinking of Annie. 
When will they stop?
You must be exhausted.
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
We'd better light some of those lamps.
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
I fear he may have to.
Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample --  Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
You asked to see me, ma'am?
You have his promise, then?
It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
I'm cold as ice.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
Well --
She's unconscious.
You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with, the street singer -- complete dissection -- a proper entry in the book --
What's that you say?
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
See that, Fettes?
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
This is not a woman!
Are you a doctor, too?
I thought this was a school day.
Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
No.
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
This is a gift.
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
Where is it? This place?
Sssshhh. She's resting.
I heard you were looking for this.
How do you know?
You killed that cop Dutton.
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
No. You don't.
This tree. Here's where it happened.
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
It's ok, it's ok...
... it connects you to me...
You know.
Just don't believe everything you see.
What is it?
What? What is it?
Sweetheart...
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
Such power exists?
Maybe a little demonstration.
Did you have a nice day, dear?
Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
What does that mean?
Did all these people die in wars?
Go to the movies.
No foolin'? Will you?
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
How does he explain that?
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
I was only hoping to make you understand.
Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
I wonder if we ought to--
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
What happened?
Just twelve.
Why not?
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
"Klaatu barada nikto."
I was.
No -- no, thanks.
But I suppose you know the answer.
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
How do you like Santa Carla?
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Death to all vampires!
We still going?
What's going' on?
What is this, David?
Where you going?
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
Leave him alone.
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
Of course not!
Smells good.  When do we eat?
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
We are...
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
Where's Michael?
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
I am?
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
Then it's not too late for us...
David's looking for me... I have to go.
It's gone.  I feel it!
This room is mine.
Where are we going?
Did you spill something?
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
Michael?
What happened, Michael!?
Who are you calling?
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
That night?
How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or...
Too damn dangerous.
... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
MacReady!
... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
Load of bullshit.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
Hey, Sweden!!!
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
After all this mess then.
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
Right.  Why not?
Put that down!
We're on fire!
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who?
He might just wait us out.
We should sleep in shifts.
Yeah!
... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
It must have been hard, leaving your work.
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
The Hall of Books.
... Well, you wanted to see it.
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
My God... I saw this.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
Why did they built it?
They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them.
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
Now will you go?
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?
You're late.
Dance with me...
Darling.
All right...
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
I've been working.
I'm sorry, David.
That's absurd --
You won't say that in a week.
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
This is magnificent...
I don't understand.
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
Yes.
You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
Oh, I'm already swooning.
Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
I am the oldest.
You won't even try?
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
Sir?
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
We are not birds of a feather.
Who are you?
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
How did you come to know their names?
Did you know my father?
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
Jackie, go play in the snow.
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
You're just gonna walk?
What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
But no one knew until after...
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
You're sure?
They're not here.
Where are we going?
What?
You gotta stop thinking like that.
I've been ok.
How you doin'?
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
And if I didn't want to come?
No. I don't want it to.
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
Exactly.
What do you mean?
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
The future doesn't look different?
Why not?
How do you know about Eugene?
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
You told me this was how it happened.
I tried to kill my wife.
I know you need one when it's really cold.
Becker does? Are you sure?
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
No.
They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
Have a good day at work today.
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
On what?
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
I've been better.
You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. So, come out alive?  I don't know. Let us think about that.
Alright.
I have no problem with that.
What kind of gun was it?
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  Someone will be here until we find them.
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!
Oh shit.
Stop.
This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?
That sounds nice.
I am the great and powerful Oz...
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
What?
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
Can I just ask you one other thing?
Will you at least see how it fits?
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
Front.
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
Whose place is this again?
'Cause I didn't ask him.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
It means shut up, Thelma.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
That's puttin' it mildly.
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it.
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery.
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
What little dogs?
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better drop it right now!  I don't want to talk about it!
Sorry!
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
What?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
Now what?
You women are crazy!
Are you going to apologize or not?
Hi!
We're fine!  How are you?
Well, uh, can you tell us his name?
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
Gay? He said you were gay?
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump.  Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
Whatever happened to Mary?
Why not?
You're kidding? What did they say?
I don't know about this, Dom.
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
Stalker, huh?
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
The sawbones?
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
By the way, what's your name?
Fine. Fine.
I know he's around here someplace.
Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
Fuck!!
All set.
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school.
She's blackmailing you, right?
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
Jai alai?
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
Mainly I work out of Boston.
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
How many is that?
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
I'd go with the seven.
I can live with those reflections.
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
So who's the lucky guy?
What's he like?
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
I don't watch the new ones.
Magda!
Pat does projects all over the world.
Not long at all, but I really like him.  Okay, I know he's a little different, Tucker, but that's what I like about him. He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts, too. And that's okay with me.
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
What's up?
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Hi, Ted.
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Are you all right?
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
By the way, how's he doing?
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Please leave.
Get over here.
Yeah? What do you want?
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
I, uh... I got it stuck.
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
No! I was pissing!
Piggyback ride.
Franks and beans!
See you, Warren.
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
He gets it, but he's pissed.
Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
I'll do it.
Jesus...
All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.
The sun came up today.
That is correct.
-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
I want an hour with him.
Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it. He can clear the air on Anglo American relations.
It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?
I don't care. Cancel it.
We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
What's that?
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
Hello?
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
Bob?
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.
What's this about?
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
What the hell you doing?!
I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
Couldn't sleep.
What'd she say?
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
Alright. Alright...
I'll sleep around a little.
This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
Hey.  Hey, you, listen up --
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
What's he smoke in that?
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.
Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
What's that?
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
This Clear Moon's house?
I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
I'll have to see what the visions say about that one.
This Jimmy's?
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I know he is.
Your relatives must've taught you something.
What?
X22. Read.
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
You ever try solitary confinement?
They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right?
The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them.
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
It isn't?
That's a big comfort to me.
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
I thought he'd never leave.
It would have been really embarrassing!
I beg your pardon.
Two.
The what?
It never came up.
What would?
Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something.  I'm sorry.
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
Yes. I'll give you that!
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
Harmless!
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
No!
You don't have to kill it.
What he said..."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.
Well no...inverse order.
Lucky charm.
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
I want it back.
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
What kind of games?
Want to play the game?
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.
One more.
I know exactly what you mean.
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
Lieutenant... Is there... a Russian attack?
Yes, Sergeant?
Can't shake him.
MAVERICK.
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
Let's hope you're right!
That's missile lock!
What are you doing?
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
So I've heard.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
Come on, we're next.
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
That's Kazanski.
He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!
But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best!
Coogan spent half the night looking for her. He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister.
GET LOST!
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
Who's the hell is that?
Helping him in.
You won?!!!
He's a good pilot.
Was going.  Now you are.
Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
Goose is dead.
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
You may not think so, but you are.
Would you take me back? Would they?
Welcome to Mars.
What happened to number five?
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
The guy's a fucking asshole.
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
Stop fighting and get out.
I'm with an very important client.
What the fuck is going on here?!  You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?!
So, been married long?
Your sexual orientation?
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
Pull them out.
I don't know.
They sell fake memories.
Yeah.
No shit...
Hey, Quaid!
Shit!
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Let me go!
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
Clever girl.
I love you.
Then I can pull this trigger, and it won't matter.
Doug...Bob McClane.
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
No options.
I don't remember you.
Not bad, for a hooker.
What reactor?!
Where's this "reactor" come from?
...Who are you?
You guys all set?
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
Yeah, like they got a plan...
What the hell is that, anyway?
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
I can't believe it.  No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
What do you think?  Max firepower or...?
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
She's got my vote.
You didn't cook breakfast?
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
You're full of shit.
Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
Oh, Jesus!!
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
Don't he have a home to go to?
You're right, don't matter where they come from.
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.
They're...they're trying to make us move!
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
How's she doing?
We playing cards tonight?
Down, honey, down.
You sure this is where it was?
I've got a plan.  You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
What's it doing?
You're fishing. You don't know shit.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
Or this -- is this a significant difference?
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
Gimme back my bottle.
Don't hurt him.
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
Objection.
You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.
What, "everything"? You shot a corpse. I don't give a shit about that -- !
Not the whole time, of course. I --
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
Ten years is a long time.
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
Uh, Eddie? The, um, ballistics guy, George...? He called, and...  His tests show that Shu's gun fired the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin.
Let's get a cab.
They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.
"The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .!
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
I embellished.
I embroidered.
The Joe Boys in 1980...!
Got any booze in the house?
Eddie this is silly... are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and --
Racist asshole came at me.
Afraid of what?
What went down?
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
'lo, Cecil.
Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
Your Honor, that's trial by ambush!
The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here!
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
Five years.
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
The phone company was broken up.
What color hair will she have?
Go away. I am not talking to you.
Here he comes.
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
The stuff we got last night.
We can do it right here.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
Well, where are you going?
Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
Is there a golf course around here?
Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
Yes...
What is it, Gordon?
Phillip?
Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
And no one found the ring?
Where is the ring?
That would indicate that it's the future.
No.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her. How well?
Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
Oh, the uncle is missing.
I see. He does talk loud.
Accidental?
Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
Noooo...
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
James called me last night looking for you.
The usual, 9:15.
Are you going to see James tonight?
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
You're not mad at me?
But I love you, Laura.
The pages are gone. That's real.
You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.
Laura, do you love me?
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
I've got to see you.
What the hell is wrong with you?
No.
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
Dad.
The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can talk to them. I want you to learn to say, "Hello, my name is Leland Palmer".
No.
Are you sure you're okay?
Leland...
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
What did he find?
He was accused of jury tampering.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
They lied.
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
Mr. Concannon...?
Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Well, many reasons, actually...
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
It's all right, Mickey.
Dr. Thompson...?
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anesthetic. Ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic.' Does that sound familiar?
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
I read the hospital report on your client.
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Hi.
Thank you.
Yes.
And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
A single hour.
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
That's it...?  Come on, guys... life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.  Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
What is it?
I had a witness disappear on me.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Nothing further, your Honor...
I object, your Honor...
What Hotel are you staying at?
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink?
Is this a bad time.
Why don't you get some rest?
Do you think it's my fault?
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
Not if you don't grow up...
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
Mr. Galvin's...
Hello, I'm calling from...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
Who are you protecting, then?
I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
We just can't do it anymore.  This is our chance to get away.
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
Another, Frank...?
Hi, Mickey...
I have to talk to you.
Are you out of your mind...?
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
How are you holding up?
That's right.
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
...four years ago...
What are you doing in New York...?
What?
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.  And they resume seven minutes...
What happened in those three minutes...?
Hey, how about that!
Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
Aw, he isn't that good...!
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there!  I'll fly you over to Pasadena.
Is that... machine...?
I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...
Nothing there now.
They've blocked it!
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
That needle ain't pointing north!
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
Colonel - shooting's no good!
General Mann -- I was told to expect you, sir.  I'm Colonel Heffner.
That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!
What'll we say to 'em?
I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
Can I read it?
And I...I've got other things happening.
Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
Heather?
What's up?
He's had some sort of...episode.
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
What?
Time for sleep.
Tomorrow night.
"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."
I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Seemed, not was.
Freddy, for all I know.
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
You're right.  That sounds crazy!
Holy...
I know how Chase really died.
The car's no there yet?
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
Captured?  How?
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
What?
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
You may not like what you hear.
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
Everyone aboard young Bill?
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!
Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
Come in.
Make us proud.
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
Albatross?
She isn't that old.
Yeah.
I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All right?!
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
Why then.
God damn it man.  I think he broke my nose!
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
Why'd you do it?
You only hurt yourself you know?
You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.
Jesus.
What'd you do?
Where are you from any way?
Who told you that?
Northeast sir!
Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
What's on your mind?
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
The Dolphin was a symptom.
I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
Stow away?
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
Is that what you were trained to do?
Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
I'll be frank with you.  This was his mother's idea.  A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
Jesus.  She's got guns.
Don't ever call me stupid.
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
If you've got "a broad" available I'll take her.
Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
They tell you that?
That's not a satisfactory answer.
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
What are we supposed to talk about?
I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.
Suicidal...
What's it going to be?
Don't look down.  Look in my eyes! Climb!  We'll do it together.
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
Yes.
The families... want your ticket. Turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  Everybody goes home.
If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here.
Bobby Peru grab you now... Hold you tight... Feel everythin' in you now... Stay quiet... Say "fuck me" and then I'll leave.
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.
Whattaya mean family?
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
You heard from Reggie?
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
That is my permiso.
Only that it's supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.
I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life.
Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin' around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days.
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
Hey baby...
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
So how'd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?
Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.
Actin' funny how?
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
...are followin' him around.
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
That don't smell like a More.
They sure do stink.
What's that, honey?
Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
What's that, peanut?
You're scarin' me, baby.
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
Lula, you there?
You upset with me?
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
Now what?
It's okay by me, peanut.
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
So where'd you say you was?
Let's leave here.
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
You must be my son.
The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
Just a place.
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.
Have it your way... But you want it.
Take care of him?
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
Put your shoulders back.
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?...
No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom...
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
He's fine. He's narrating.
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
It's the Chancellor.
It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
I just mean...
Yes.
Wait here. I'll be right back.
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
James? My James? What's happened?
Is he awake?
So -- what do we do now?
Naturally you have copies.
The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.
Came to my senses.
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
I've been trying to finish a book...
Who's got a gun?
Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
Who the hell is that?
Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
Hello?
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
Well...
Really? That's remarkable.
The one she wore on her wedding day?
I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
Whose tuba is that anyway?
Can I ask you something about her?
This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out.
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
Oh.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Professor Tripp?
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
Isn't this...?
Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.
When we fall, we fall hard.
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
Maybe she didn't come here.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
What?
You're lying.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
But, last night...
I'm sorry.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
What would you call them then?
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
I'm not going with them.
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
I'm a little worried, James.
Me? Sure. Why?
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
Jesus.
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
Professor Tripp.
I got the message you called.
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
Well...
Not have it.
Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too.
I'm kidding. Hello?
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
Who's that sitting in your car?
Sara.
I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
Does he still love you?
The more the merrier.
Who's he barking at now?
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
Where's Emily, Hank?
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
Are you riding with me, James?
Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know...  He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg, pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane -- he was good -- pills. Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
Annette? She's good... tense.
Cherry.
Aren't you glad?
It's not what you think.
Carlos, can I ask you something?
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
How does it sound?
I'd love to hear it.
What are you writing in that book?
You don't know?
I would.
It's not for sale.
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
The one with the ax?
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
You don't know?
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
I wasn't feeling well.
And your new apartment?
But you are taking it?
People have the right to know.
Yeah, like the bird.
I'm twelve.
No.
Banished... yeah.
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.
Yes.
You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you.
But will he... ?
How do you know?
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
Walter?
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
Why not?
I don't understand.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
How's the journal?
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
You have no feelings for your niece?
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
Is that what you are angry about?
How long is this going to take?
I don't know.
You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.
Close your eyes.
Where?
But roughly, how old?
Don't ever do that again.
I don't like nobody behind my back!
What else?
She's still really hurt... and angry. I don't know... if she will ever... forgive me. I understand that. I do. I just hope... I just want her to...
What?
Want a ride?
Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore?
You don't hang out with the other guys.
Southern light.
They could eat you.
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
Hey, there.
Look, you can go now.
Why don't you just go now, okay?
Depraved? My mistake.
What was prison like?
You really believe that?
I got poked around... here and there.
All three -- in chronological order.
You're scared.
We should live together.
I don't even know how to live with myself.
Thank you.
You okay?
I heard they were filthy birds.
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
Okay, good reason.  Then what?
You done impressing yourself, ace?
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
Okay so far.
Lord Almighty.
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
You never did like being called that, did you?
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
You wanna know what I think?
I think you were worried about me.
I haven't worn mine in months.
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women nervous.
What's the scoop, ace?
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
You owe me one, Virgil.
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
You see where it's coming in?
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...
Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack.
Virgil?
That's Perry.
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Hey, you guys are milking that job.
'Fish'?
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
4800 feet.  It's official.
8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay?
He can still make it.
When do you have to go back?
Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.
Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.
And how long will you be away?
But how could you say such a thing?
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?
There's no comparison.
Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
Don't be so humble.
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
What is it, Claudia?
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
Why are you looking at me like that?
Claudia, let's get married?
And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...
Then I'll see you later.
No, Sandro... Please...
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
What are you saying?
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
But where did you finally end up?
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
Patrizia, I'm afraid.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
Who are you talking to?
And tell Corrado, too, that I'm here... if he wants me. You can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad, and that at this moment, it's the only thing that interests me. Is that clear?
I'll stay here also.
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
Ettore...
You men are all so dreadful!
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
Yes, sir. Three times.
And what did they say about me?
Music, of course. To get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one.
Patrizia, what are you going to do?
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
Your mother?
As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
No.
I'm not hungry.
I'm being punished.
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
For what?
First thing that comes to your mind?
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
I don't know.
Yes.
I got sicker.
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
What do you mean?
Anything?
What's your real name?
Would you like to be?
Where do you think babies come from?
Why should I?
What else did she tell you?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
Agnes, did you love your mother?
Why not?
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
She can't hurt you any more.
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
And that you're stupid?
That you're a mistake?
You're a mistake.
To be a mother?
Yes.
Which one?
Who?
The statue. She had shown it to me the day before.
Yes.
Him.
She'd seen him too.
It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop.  Let go of me, I wish you were dead.
I hate him.
God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
???
Look into the convent records.
Larry there's got to be something missing.
All I want is one more week.
I'll have it.
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
Yes.
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
Who was the father?
Could there have been anyone else?
Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
I was appalled, just as you are now.
???  
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
What?
How?
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
Visitors to the convent.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Sister Paul?
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
And my permission?
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
Would you like one?  Huh?
Pipe!
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
I'd like to begin.
I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
The father!
Don't be ridiculous.
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
Somebody told her.
Was it you?
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
Too late for what?
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
She can't remember.
Oh, don't do this!
Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
Nine.
Oh, it's all right.
Can you fix him for me?
Sure.
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
Ever seen one of these before?
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
Are you going in?
I don't snore.
Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
That's not your Grandfather.
Gerron.
Did you look in here?
What's up?
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
Thank you.
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
But that's not like a real person at all.
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
A book!
Where are you off to?
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
Anything to spare?
We've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!  Eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent.
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
Let's have you.
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
Hi Norm!
You've got a midnight matinee.
Well, you look like him.
And my nose...
Eh, where's my grandfather?
What do you think are you're up to?
Paul's grandfather.
Down the ... er ...
Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
Oh, a little savage, is he?
I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
Where's Irth?
I don't recognize that constellation.
I got it.  Oh boy.
Any rotation?
Gravity?
Except it will take 75 years to get a reply back.  Don't forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin.
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
Computer!  I've turned all the cooling units back on!  What's wrong?
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
How long to fix?
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?
Yes?  What is it?
Dead!
Hurt!  How?
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
There.  Should be coming through about there.
You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.
No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping.
He's running a fever.
Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!
If we could just get the <u>creature</u> into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
The flamethrower!
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
Look at that.
This is horrible.
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
Don't count on it.
Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?
... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.
Isn't "bait" the word you used?
Sandy, you want to give us some vision?
That way.
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
How?
We do know that.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
Where are we?
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Martin?
I understand why you did that.
Where did the parasites come from?
I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
Let's hear it.
No, it won't work and I just realized why.  There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.
Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured.
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
No... don't...
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
Let's get back and call this in.
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
Minh...
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
How many of them are there?
Are you alright?
Where is she?
Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive.
When?
Deal.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
De Vries?
Hey, Guttierez?
Alright, okay.  Look...
Hold it, hold it...
Is it still moving?
Move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones!
We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
And...?
Already working on it.
Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
Six month stint on Datus.
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
Yeah.  Somebody won.
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.
That's the wrong way!
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
Hungry?
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
You sat and talked until it was light...
What do you take me for?
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
She was a liar, she was a liar!
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
I was there. An eyewitness.
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
Didn't you know?
How... how was Miss Caswell?
In time she'll be what you are.
Bill...
Nothing?
Forty-five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard-
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
You're my girl, aren't you?
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
Many happy returns of the day...
I love you too. Good night, darling-
Need any help?
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
When I'm guest of honor?
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
It's all over.
What fire and music?
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
No, I'll tell it to you! For the last time, I'll tell it to you. Because you've got to stop hurting yourself, and me, and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums!
Well, I am.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve?
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
Why?
I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
- and for you.
Find out.
Lemme fix you a drink.
Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie.
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
Kill the people.  Got your key?
You bought the new girdles a size smaller. I can feel it.
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
An answer.
I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
You probably won't believe me.
I'm going to take you to Margo...
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
I think I know...
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
No, thank you.  Yes. I've seen every performance.
How'd hear about it?
Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?
Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and I, then go somewhere and talk.
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
The curtains. I made them myself.
While you're cleaning up, I'll take this to the wardrobe mistress-
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
Ain't it the truth?
How much time have we?
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
Not to you. Not to Bill.
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
With tears?
I remember.
You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book-
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
If we could cast it properly, that is...
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
How about calling it a night?
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.
When you do, let me in on it.
How's the new one coming?
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
She's your understudy.
Yes, sir.
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
Call, what call?
That's right, but I don't understand-
"Liebestraum."
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
"Liebestraum."
Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max?
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
Anything to help you out, Max.
This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!
Are you breaking the contract?
You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.
What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
That was fun.  What now?
Goddamnit--
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
See her?  Get anything?
Who's first?
I don't get it... this really was my turf...
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
'68.
--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
--we gotta top the Times--
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
--Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--
Woodward?
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
--jeeeeeeesus--
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything?
Sorry.  Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--
Hi, it's me. I'm still here.
I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
By "they" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.
But you know who did.
Can't help you.
--you got more than one source?--
--no--
--and we got a guy in Justice--
I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story--  --you think I like being aced out?
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
FBI too?
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
One minute but then--
Who by?
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
Are you implying you don't believe me?
She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
--this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in--  --and I was kind of curious about your check.
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
My turn to keep you waiting.  What's the topic for tonight?
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
What?
I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?
Are you sure?
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
What'd you get on W.House?
Who's Charles Colson?
Howard--
--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--
What else have you got?
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
--which Young?
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
Go on.
A boy or a girl?
--look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?
Great evening, isn't it?
Good morning gentleman.
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
This is your plan, Finch?
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
Why are you doing this?
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
This isn't any better, Chris.
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
You got it, stud.
Do you?
I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.
Are you kidding?  No.
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
Give it to me!  Yes!
You're so big!
Fuck me!  Yes!
There's our man.
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  Jim?
You're not...busy?
I know, Dad.
Dad.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Yes.  Seriously.
Whatever you want.
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Yeah, bring it on!
She's a mermaid, dude.
I still think you're okay.
Yes.
James!  You have come in here on purpose?!
You are done, James.  Perhaps I should be going now.
No, not again.
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
Ho-lee shit.
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
I was being selfish.  And majorly insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot.
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
Victoria...I love you.
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
NOVA!!
You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
Our last game is this Saturday.
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
Here, babe.
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
Sure. I can follow that.
Salots! Shitfucker!
Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
Like an underground club?
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.
What about your glasses?
Serafine...
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
Are you crazy!?
Holy mother of God...
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
Whoa...
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
Oh God. Shit...
There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
Before the coma!
Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM!  Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else!
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
We know you were with her.
Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
Andy...
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
Uncle Terrence, you're...
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
Why would he pick this one?
Not that I know.
Shit. I feel sick.
Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -
Andy, stop! I think he can help you - 
Andy!
What've you got?
Merde.
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
Saint Severin...
I have to go now, before it gets light.
Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
Did I tell you that?
Every Russian family has one..
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
I'm so scared...
Anya, wait!
So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
How is our current financial status?
The "Odessa Dunk"?
Please, if you'd just listen...
Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
She does.
Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
I did no such thing!
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
Perhaps you could convince her?
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
Yes.
H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
Stop it, Alvy!
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
Well, then, w-who was?
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
So sorry.
Oh - you're an actress.
Oh, right.
You want your tennis stuff?
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
I'll see yuh.
Oh, sorry.
Neat?
Uh, narcolepsy.
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
Why not?
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
Yeah?
And we'll digest our food better.
Yeah?
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
Here, you want some?
Yeah?
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
big subject with me, yeah.
I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
Look at these guys.
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel."
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
Well, what is your definition of following?
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
It's his name.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-
What?
Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning. You, uh, you got me outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible?
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
You were-you were sensational. I mean, I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, I-I-you- you were sensational.
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
That's sick!
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
God.
I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
What'd I do?
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
Tsch, a few.
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience.
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with- with-with-
Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license.
Stop calling me Max.
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
Max, the city is terribly worried.
Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
How about a ginger ale?
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
M'hm.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
They're persecuted enough!
Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.
Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
M'mmm.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, really, oh!
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
There were many men interested in you?
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
Had a little help?
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you.
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
She already has.
So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
Why didn't you bring him?
Oh.
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
You look so well, Clair.  A wraith.
So where is young Jonah?
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
Would you leave us alone right now?
Take good care of it.
I'm the hired help.
That for us?
Can I open it?
So?
Stupid tart.
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
Oh.  You're them.
Cal, my wife Judy.
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?
We closed.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
Yes.
Accept a compliment.
I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
Otis!  No barking!
It's an unfair advantage.
Don't be so sure.
She left the fucking gate open.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Fuck you.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
It's not like this all the time.
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
I don't look my age, Joe.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
No.
It's a novel.
Joking.
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
Lemon or raspberry?
Ryan's really angry with me.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
How's he doing?
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
Ready to go?
Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around.  Because, God help you if something happens to that dog?
Hors d'oeuvres or something?
I...
I was impressed.
Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
Would you, like, marry him?
Will champagne help?
Panes is here!
Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
Like the last time.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
So how are you really doing, Panes?
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
Um.  Happy for you.
Thank you, Panes.
What did I do?
You don't need to do that.
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
Nevermind.
Isn't this a fabulous picture?
I don't have a drug problem.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!  Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
Are you asking me out to dinner?
Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca...
So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?
He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
You're right!
You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
What <u>was</u> that thing?
I order you to find out where we are!
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
Worker!  Come back here now!
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
So what makes you so special?
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
Z!  Over here!
Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
...I should?
We declared war again?  Are you scared?
You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
Say, you got a lulu.
I hope everything goes all right.
No.
You mean tonight?
You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
What is it?
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
You are?
Do I have to?
Are you all right?
What are you doing with that?
Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.  I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN  Why not?
I know so. He's a taker.
Here.
No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
We're going to finish that gin game.
How's everything at the apartment?
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
Baxter?
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
Who?
Oh.
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
Where are you going, Baxter?
I am?
Not that I have anything to hide.
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
Hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, Baxter?
Sir?
You're going to take her off my hands?
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
Yes, sir.
Very clever.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
No key!
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
Hi, Baxter.
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
You threatening me?
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
Help yourself.
I'm not sure.
Yeah, wasn't I?
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
Still stuck on her, huh.
Say, this is Snugsville.
Not so rough, honey.
Good night?
Sleeping pills.
Dreyfuss.
And what happened to you?
Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
Yes, I know.
I don't know what you're talking about.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
Remember what we talked about?
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.
We need all our fuel anyway.
What's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me.
That's good gin.
Why they call you that?
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
How?
I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --
What do you see?
Charlie?
He killed that guy without feeling anything.
You forgot the mangoes, didn't you?
Flood.
I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
Smoke !
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
What the hell is it?
Will they attack?
I never heard about that.
Our Recon flight ?
Touchy.
Terminate ?
Yeah.
I thought he was a lame.
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?
Good swell.
You smell that.  You smell that?
Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.
This is Baker Delta Four -- Captain hit bad -- need dust-off. Receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from huts about thirty yards to our left.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one.
Fucking savages.
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts --
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
I had immense plans.
Yes...
And you admired him?
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
Maybe he'll get tubed.
No -- no, Captain.
You hear it again?
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
Captain Willard?
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son.
What will you do after the war?
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta --
Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?
Where's your chief supply officer?
23   CONTINUED:
117  CONTINUED:  
What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
119  CONTINUED:  
27   CONTINUED:
How long have you been up north?
My dad was a Navy doctor.
Oh.
What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
Have you talked to Eric?
What are you doing?
Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.
Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things.
When you ran off, I thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in Washington.
Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
Surviving is what I know --
Sounds like professional jealousy.
Stay put!
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
Have to get these wet things off.
Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?
Don't push me..!
I already have.
You wouldn't shoot anyone...
All this for laying traps on private land?
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
You better get some sleep.
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.
Hey, Sam, look over there.  Black and white smoke.
He saw you and Corbett come in...
Dead.  Trappers killed him.
I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when Ben is standing trial. They don't know shit about Ben or Wilder!
I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind.
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
You're not still writing that thank-you note?
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
What is it you want? What?
It's amazing these things weren't done.
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
I'm starving.
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
You're not worried that someone might take him?
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
What needs clearing up?
I'm not kidding.
What's this?
So. Anything else?
Lovely.
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Hi.
I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
I'll never forget you said it.
I don't want to hear that music right now.
I'll take you... why not?
Hello.
The two might go together.
I should've danced with you.
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
No!!!
But what about...
Help!
You changed the room around...
Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
What?
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
Good evening.
Okay. So you call 911 and don't leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name. How come you make a mistake like that?
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
Now we'll both call him.
Would you leave now, please?
I brought you Chinese soup.
I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
You going to come talk to me or not?
Picking on me won't help.
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
Exactly what is your previous experience?
Wait -- I want to see the painting.
Where you from?
No shit.
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
Bain.  Michael Bain.
So what happens now?
Okay.
What are you doing?
Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.
I'm on the scent.
How in the fuck do you know that?
What?
Hello, Robert.
Why?
He wants to kill you?
I don't need the money.
Oh Jesus Jesus...
No.
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
Women?  No... not really.
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
That's where he'll be.
It helps me to focus.  It centers me, helps me think.
Do you think about the game?
Do you think he's here?
Really?
Where did you learn it?
Two way?
What did he want?
You didn't take it.
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
Nobody ever sees me.
She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex.
No?
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
Did you --
Is this becoming complicated?
Were you attracted to me right away?
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
That doesn't sound normal.
Martin.
I waited another four minutes.
Electra --
I wasn't watching television.
For what?
Thank you.
Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Right.
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
Why didn't you fade?
Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
Cheers Katka!
Your a good guy Chris you deserve a nice girl.
Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.
It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.
Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG  until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
Tell them we're working for the University.
I'm an idiot?
Perfect, but I can't use it right now, I've got to get these locks done; it's a matter of priorities.
Moved on to plumbing huh?
Let's split.
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
So why didn't we?
Red or white?
Have you cleared all the rubble up?
What happened to Katka?
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
Chris, can you do me a favour?
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
And if you're wrong.
If I cut a deal, I'm not staying in this country and I want Holly to come with me. So, if she doesn't come here today, you're going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after I call, promise?
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.
I hope you're going to invite me in?
That's not true, we have a great time together. I've said I'm sorry. Let's forget about it and go stop by my place, so I can get changed.
Will it help to get you out?
Forget about me Kat.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
Tomorrow, we will bring some lights and also hang some fabric. I think it will be finished in the morning.
What would you like, beer?
I'd better get you to a hospital.
Where did you steal the car?
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
Really!
How do I know this isn't a trap?
I'll need to make a phone call.
That's okay I like the metro, it's only a couple of stops from here.
Hey Doug, where you been?
Great, let's break for lunch and I'll buy you a beer on the way.
Josh!
So, what have you got to say for yourself? Was he good in bed?
Will you come home and forget all about him?
You are quite sure it's secure?
You are responsible...What has happened?
So, who is in the building?
She's coming over here...
Your father dropped off an extra check.
You saw him?
A late night or an early morning?
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
I'm thinking.
The address?!
And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.
I'm very sorry --
Get yourself a glass.
You don't know me.
Can't you have a normal conversation?
'I hope your dreams come true.'
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
Yeah.
What the -- ?!
The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.
I know. Don't say anything.
You have to believe to have faith.
Or anywhere where people might see us.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
Is there a rush?
It's only 7:30.
Before we do this.
It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously.
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
I don't understand...
I might do it wrong.
What's wr--?
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
Can you locate XXI5639I?
Jamie --
Why didn't you tell me?
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
Nope.
Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here.  I could start by driving her to school --
You know how to waltz??
'What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.' Aristotle.
Can I -- go out?
Boys like him have -- expectations.
You're in the play?
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
Materially or spiritually?
Landon. You go on home.
You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself.  Some of us remember how your father --
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
This is 1952....?
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
Dad, you seen the drill?
Oh yeah.
The sunrise? What for?
'Bike fine point?'
How many times do I have to explain it to you?... We know you're not a fighter. You know it, I know it... but she doesn't know it. That's why we gotta make you look like a fighter, somebody who'll stand up for her, somebody who isn't chicken. And you're not gonna look like a fighter if you can't hit me in the stomach.
Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me -
You mean, you're gonna --
Maybe if I used my left....
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
What, am I radioactive or something?
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.
Pardon me?
Say, where did this guitar come from?
That's all taken care of.
Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.
That's just what I needed to hear.
It was sure nice of Uncle Sam to put those yardage markers up for us. 
What happened to Dick Wilson?
What did you do to your hair?
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
Where'd you get them antlers?
You lost that one?
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
I mean it.
Hi.
That's my father. I got to run.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
You know what I think?
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
How you doing?
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter.
Hi.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
What's that?
You're my friend, aren't you?
Morning... Say, you got any gas?
All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
We will, old fried, we will.
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
Dead.  Damnit!
Where're you goin'?
And they got Penny!  Look!
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
You keep an eye on it.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
Stay here, I'll be back.
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Pictures don't lie.
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
Any sign of Buckaroo?
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
Let him go.
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
If you could, I'd 
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
Well I have to come up with  an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks  well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational
I write.
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
Well that's what he said.
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.
...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
...I don't guess this means much to you.
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and  and  and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if  well I know I sometimes run on.
Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
Thanks, I'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess. You married, Bart?
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself 
And there's hope for you too, Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen policies.
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Hold on 
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
Jesus, Charlie, I...
But Charlie  why me? Why 
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
L.A.P.D.
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
We got a treatment on it yet?
Take care, you hear?
You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it?
So -- how are things?
Yes.
Catherine Tramell.
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
Who?
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports.
What do you want, Nick?
She told you, didn't she?
Why did you change your name?
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
Do you have a cigarette?
I told you -- I quit.
You like playing games, don't you?
I passed.
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
I didn't.
Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be.
My wife used to call me that.
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
When did you write it?
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me.  I'm going down to Johnny's club.
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
You shouldn't play this game.
It's OK.  It's OK.
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
No.
You won't believe me.
About three months before I met you.
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
No thanks.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
Why not?
Why?
I finished my book.
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
What do we do now, Nick?
How did he die?
You have the right to an attorney.
It teaches you to lie.
In the beginning.  Then I got to like what he did for me.
I never heard of him.
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
How'd it go, son?
What you doin', son?
Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?
No, sir.  You won't.  There's smoke off yonder on the horizon.  They're gonna want your badge.
I don't know.
You think I --
I'm not afraid of her.
It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago.
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake. She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is.
Maybe the maid did it.
Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.
You sure?
Fuck you, Phil.
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
I'm a painter, too.
When's your show?
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
Of what?
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
Saddle River, New York!
Ouch..
What's with the wigs?
Piss painting?
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
Who is it?
I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
Jean, your parents are here.
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!
You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
Yes. What do they... stand for?
Not what?
Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he?
OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
Who's that?
Famous people are usually pretty stupid. You're too smart. You'd get bored to death. You don't wanna be like John Henry  fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It's about integrity. Follow your heart.
What're you doing? You're doing something.
No, don't tell me  you just got fired by your crazy boss.
I thought you hated this place?
What's wrong with me?
Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're 
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
What's your name, man?
That's a beautiful name. French?
You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star.
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
You don't have any!!!
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...
Where's the fire?
I can't sleep either, lately.  A little link, between us.  But bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I'm dying to disturb it.  That could put a strain on our relationship.
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?
You almost sound enthusiastic.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
And the truth frightened her?
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
Y'mean frame him?
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
You buy this "blurry" business?
Ten, nine...
... eight, seven...
Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
Working late?  I'm touched.
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
You certainly will not.
I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.  And...
Uncle Alfred?
Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze.  Batman monopolized the evening news.
It's good to see you.
First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.
Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
Alfred, are you...?
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
Pow!  What!  Kazow!
Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.
... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
Watch the first step.
We gotta get those locks changed.
If we could relay the sunlight-
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
You're not even listening to me.
I wouldn't bet on that.
Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
Like hell you do.
That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
How about, MR. E.
What now sir?
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
Up here, Al.
_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
We all wear masks.
You are direct, aren't you?
Help Chase. I'll be back.
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
What? Oh, it's very impressive.
No grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms.  Skol.
La'chiem.
Still play with dolls, Doctor?
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
What do you know about obsession?
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
He sure did.
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
Okay. I'm outta here.
Back off, man.
What the hell did you think you were doing?
You can't-.
_We_ sure are.
How'd you find us?
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
No.  Wait...
Not until you do that thing I like.  On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie...  Woah. Harsh toke.
Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.
Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy.
Excuse me, sir.  Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  He asked me to convey his regrets.
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
Where's the boy?
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
GET IN THE CAR!!
What about the girl?
Odd desire for anyone.
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
My brother's a priest, man.
I understand.
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
That's it?
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
... Why the mask?
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
No.
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Alexander... I know you.
Not what?
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
There aren't hotels?
Go ahead.
Liar.
Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ...
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
Two dollars please.
Better go.  Grierson hates people being late.
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
I was hoping DU.  Bean might take a look at my computer project today.
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
He's just parking the Governor's car.
Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!
Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?
Ah... He certainly has something, sir.
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.  All Englishmen are ugly.
Welsh again.
Bye, Dad.
You arrange those flowers yourself?
You know the thing I hate most about children?
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score. Huh huh.
This sucks.
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay us. We can buy a new TV.
Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
Ow! These chips suck.
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
Heh heh. We're in Washington!
Damn, huh huh.
Check it out Butt-Head, porta-potties.
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Uh...
Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird. I think I'm freaking out.
Well where is she?!
Uh... Attention, attention! We're looking for that chick with the big boobs.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
They perk me right up.
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
...Two...
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
Chief, look!
Cool. Huh huh huh.
Cool, huh huh huh.
Really? That's where we're from.
You got two seconds!
You'll be rich!
Oh no.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.
You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
What?
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
I feel really stupid.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
Aren't you scared?
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
All right.  Who are you?
Just get some people out of our house.
Just one daughter.
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
No.
No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
I want to be dead too.
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
Three syllables.
Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
He's your cousin.
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
Where is your mother?
I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
What?
Dad.  Do you believe me?
The attic room is locked --
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
What do you think?
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
What's happening to them?
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
Otho, that's terrible.
<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
... Were you going somewhere?
He does, does he?
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
Do you know Raphael?
I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
Would you care to take it, sir?
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
... Why... No, I don't think so...
... Good night, Chauncey.
Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?
Oh, I like that very much.
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President.  ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail.
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
I feel very good in here.
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
Certainly, Ben.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
... Then you really are a gardener?
What about money?
I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.
This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
... That is a very small room.
... Evening, Chance.
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say? More gobbledegook?  That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you!
Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
... How long have you been living here?
How were you paid?
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
Yes. I will.
Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached...  ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve.
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
... Yeah...
No! He's a real gardener!
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown.
This is not what I requested.
Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files.
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Is the trial date set?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
I was worried.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
I have to go back now.
I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?
How was it?
Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
What about Maxine?
We?
Suck my dick!
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
No.
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
Why not?
Who told you?
What'll you have?
Im not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
You wanted to be partners with me?
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
You're glowing again.
Lotte, this is so good...
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
No. Don't be an ass.
Two hundred dollars, please.
Vegas? What'd you think?
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
Thank you, Floris.
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
Says me. Do you dream often?
Aaaahhhh, the portal!
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
How'd you get this number?
Thanks so much for coming over.
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
I'm getting better all the time.
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
You got to go sometime. You got to go out there by yourself sometime.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
You saying nothing counts?
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
You don't sit with me!!
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
What you want'em for?
Won't you be late for work?
She likes this dress...
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
Out where?
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
You planning to do anything about it?
I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
No, You looking good.
What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
Uh-huh.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
The Gundersons.
Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen.
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
Sir, please lower your voice--
Yeah.
What's this?
Sheesh.
Where you going, Dude?
What tied the room together, Dude?
He peed on the Dude's rug--
Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
What do you need that for, Dude?
Those are good burgers, Walter.
What have you.  We'll, uh--
And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
I've heard the kidnapping story, so save it.  I know you're mixed up in all this, Dude, and I don't care what you're trying to take off her husband.  That's your business.  All I'm saying is, I want mine.
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?
Oh yeah?
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Yeah, but my-
A hundred.
Yeah, but what about--
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
And please don't call her my mother.
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.
No, but--
Theodore Herzel.
That...fucking...bitch!
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs--
We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks up our plan.
Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski?
"Our" car, Walter?
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Yeah.
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
Who the fuck is that?
No.
Uh.
Is this your homework, Larry?
Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your homework, Larry?
Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not--
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
Yeah, and you were--
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
There weren't any shots.
Well can we--
You make everything a fucking travesty!
Dude here.
Yeah.
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
We know the briefcase was empty, man.  We know you kept the million bucks yourself.
Well?  Aren't you?
Oh, shit.
Bullshit. Walter!
I'm not--
Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle.
Whatta we do about the Mex?
What?
What about Nomak?
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
Blade.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
It means "bloodbrother."
How do you feel?
Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst for good.  I'll be watching you close. You start to back-slide --
He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
What's your problem, Whistler?
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
And so will we.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
And why is that?
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
What's going on?
Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
What the fuck you doing?
His name is Jared Nomak.
We're locked in.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
Pretty.
She's been bitten.
What took you so long?
Whistler, I --
Beautiful day, isn't it?
It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, "the Day-walker".
The pause that refreshes --  Care for some? Smells good, doesn't it? Pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of iron.
You shouldn't be here.
Why?
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
But, he could've --
Like what?
What is this place?
What am I injecting you with?
I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
How long have we been driving?
No --
This isn't human blood.
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".
Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
LaMagra --
You're a monster.
I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race.
The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
Why do you hunt them?
Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?
What happened to her, where did she go?
Inside the grave?
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
The bitched-out babe in back here is one Anna Tassio--we met one dark and stormy night in a Blair Witch chat room, we all did--
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
What's she look like?
--how old?
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--
Your body, your call.
Anna--
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
For once could you just sit down, shut up, and give something a <u>chance</u>?
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
--hours before--
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
How'd you know they were--
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
I don't think it was them.
Hey, <u>chill</u>, man--
Can't you like just divine it?
So lemme see it.
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
I don't believe this.
Nice tent.
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
We should be so lucky.
What're you, crazy??
What about night?
English.
Where's Domini?
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
Cotter?
You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
They're making "Blair Witch II," too.
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
Let's get inside.
Running a junk yard.
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
--whatever you want, no problem--
Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.
Just hold on!
--it's less than four feet, just--
That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
At least go drink it somewhere spilling it won't drive him to suicide.
Elly Kedward?
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
Heather.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
What the fuck's going on here?
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
...Ray?
What was that?
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
I could've sworn I heard something.
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
Hello?
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
...What?
Why didn't you get into bed?
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
...You leaving?
...So?
Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line?
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
...So what're you doing tonight?
Christ, I'm getting bored.
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
I told you. I like you.
Sign.
Yeah.
...Just doin' my job.
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
...Anything else?
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
What's this?
This.
That's not the point.
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. goddam!!! This is the suavest guy I know. look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. this beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Come into the study a minute.
I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Jeffrey?
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Okay?
Hello, baby.
Who's this fuck?
Look at these. What are these?
Frank. he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. come on. He didn't mean it.
That oughta do it.
Shit. You better tell me something.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
Don?
Yes.
You don't?
. I. uh.
Who is Don?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.?
No. I should go.
What do you want to do?
You like to open me. don't you?
Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone.
I asked first.
You. what?
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
Are you alright?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
What did you see?
Wow. Should you tell my father?
Okay. be careful.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
You were late.
Shoot.
Everything okay?
Dorothy! ... Dorothy!
Probably not. no. Why?
Good to see you, son.
I'm going out for awhile.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Well.
No. you're right.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
What are watchin' this junk for?
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Come on out a minute, okay?
Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
Blanca, por favor.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Honey, your nose!
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
You can't sell this to your friends.
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
Why are you speaking?
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
What the fuck is that?
What can I do for you guys?
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
And I only deal with you?
I don't think so.
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
No, my brother.
Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
George, I am happy to see you.  How are you, my brother?
Yeah, layaway.
Surprised to see me?
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
Yeah.  Nice.
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
Money.
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
You mad at me?
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
Figured it out.
But this is...
Alright.
Where are you going?
Not in front of the kid.
There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone.
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
I didn't mean to...
I fucked up.
Because she's visiting me.
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
Nice weed, huh?
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
What "group"?
You afraid of these ...?
Where's Kader?
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
But it's not even midnight yet!
You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
Who is speaking?
How you doin' Mister D?
Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - -  I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me.  I mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
I'm sorry to barge in -- but I figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news?
Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting.  I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler.
An inquiry into what?
So she knew about his heart?
That's what my report will read.
No questions.
Objection, Your Honor.
Can you?
C'mon -- think about it.  If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?
How long were you together?
And how are you now?
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
Yes.
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
What kind of information?
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
October twenty-seventh.
I heard him say it.
No.
Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
What about Miss Lawson?
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
Yes.
Three fifteen.
P.M.
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler in the first place?
Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
-- And then?
This is your house.
Is it against the law?
I'm the photographer.
That's not an answer.
Tell me about Doctor Paley?
Really?
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
Can I see you later?
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
What are you going you doing?
Alright, I'll talk to her
Michael -- get off the phone.
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
What's she like?
She sounds like quite a woman.
What's wrong?
Please -- not now.
Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!
Yes.
Did Marsh use it?
It had to get there somehow.
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
Well, I can help.
Lawyer here?
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
Yeah.
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
I can't believe she's making jokes.
Grateful!?
Bar across the street.
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
Carolyn!
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
Mrs. Delaney.  Did you hear the latest?
Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
Roseman Bridge?
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
Oh there you are.
Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?
Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.
I doubt that.
Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
What?
Why, do you think?
Well, it's kind of buggy out there.
When?
Woman friends, too?
You really don't need anyone?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
Listen, I'm sorry I --
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?
Yes.
Yes.
You're somewhere else, where?
Sleep all right?
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
What do you want me to say?
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
You feeling better Franny?
Where you going?
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
Want anything special for dinner?
Okay.
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Don't feed that dog.
You didn't hear that?  "Take him... " Something.  "Bury him" or...
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
You want us to move in here?
Where's the others?
You got a nice crib here.
What else?  Money.
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
What it will be.
I don't understand it.  You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas.  I always looked after you.  You had a piece of everything I had.
Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
Have you ever been inside?
And what's that?
...I've seen things.  In there.  Last night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you didn't.  You were crying like a baby.
In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something.  Covered with blood.
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In this house.
I can't.  Not yet.
Here, find my hand.  The stairs are right near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk up there.
Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it.  Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't shitting you.
What are we doing down here?
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
Nice rack.  How old is --
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
We just thought...
We didn't do nothing, Eddie.
You boys been hitting the pipe?
You gotta use your imagination.
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?
There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.
Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.
That's right, I know.  I fucking know.
Caesar!
Sit down, Gino!
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
They were early.
You mean they weren't up here?
It's impossible!
I hate that little fuck!  I hate him!  I hate him!  I should've done him!
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
Got to think this through ...
Violet, please!
He didn't see you, did he?
I need you ...
If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.
All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way, I can play it this way. You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case.
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
Where is the money?
Stupid cunt!
Don't try to tell me what to do.
You murdered Gino!
What?
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
How's it going tonight, fellas?
Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
You can't kill me yet.
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
Cease, can I ask you something?
You got the key?
Hello?
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
So this is temporary for you?
I guessed you were straight black.
Yeah.
I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --
Okay, one drink.
No.
No.
Five years is a long time.
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
What's wrong?
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly.  They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  You fuck them, you've got to do it right.
Gino Marzzone.
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
There is no going back.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
I had a partner and she fucked me.
He totally freaked.  I've never seen him like this.  He's out of his fucking mind.
You know what the difference is between us, Violet?
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
What do you mean?
Treadstone.
What is Treadstone?
Who do you think sent me?
Sir, you waited on line.
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
Was it the break-in?
I've got a situation here and --
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
So what's in Paris?
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
That's what I'm saying.
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
What are you talking about?
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
Okay, so you're a victim.
I needed a break.
We're about an hour away.
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
Where?
This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?
He's dead isn't he?
He came to kill us.
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
xxxxxx.
Yes.
Shit, we didn't sign in.
He run away often?
What the hell're you talking about?
Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
-- and they're sure it's him? --
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
-- what're you talking about? --
It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich?
You telephone, sir.
Tuttle! ... mumble!  You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
In fact, killing people -
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
Thanks very much Sam.
Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
Please, I've got to find Jill.
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
Enough though, eh?
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Out of kindness.
They weren't at school with us.
Trust me.
How do you think I feel? You shit!
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
Where do I get it stamped?
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
I bet you'd like to touch them?
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer -  DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them! 
... This is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you ...
Why not?
OK. What's in the parcel?
We've got both.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
They'll be there waiting.
Will you please turn back.
Turn!
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
We? Don't blame me!
What?
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Oh my God, a mistake!
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
A cheque.
Tuttle?
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
I never signed the form.
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.
It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce. 
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
Put the phone down and your hands up.
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
But we can get one.
What is it?
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.
Are you expecting anyone?
Thank you very much. How much will it...?
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
No, no, that's impossible.
Es impossible.
You know each other a long time?
In that time, you ever have sex?
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
Frank Pierce.
Where is she?
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
You're not going to die.
Is there any chance?
I think this place stinks.
Did you see my father?
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
Five years.
You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
Don't seem so bad to me.
Promise you won't go inside.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
Three legs.
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
Where you going?
That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.
What do you think?
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
I'm sorry.
Would you like to come in?
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
Where you going?
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
Do it!
Oh no!--I just remembered.
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
He's crazy.
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra.
Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
You were smokin' toward the end there.
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
You packing up tonight?
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?
Of course.
Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
Did you bring your grey suit?
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
What?
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
How?
Why not try it for a few weeks?
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
We came from Washington.
Just when do you start, telling people?
Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
But thanks.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
It's Aaron.
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
They canned me.  Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
Is everything all right?
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
...good-bye then.
Ernie, they're calling from work.
You don't have to finish tonight.
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
Why so glum?
Go ahead.
As long as that's your only problem you're...
Hi.  I was worried I was early.
If we could just eat first.
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
I'll wait for you till seven.
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
So what did you think?
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
Hi.  It's me.
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
No.  Did he really?
Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
I don't wan to discuss work.
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
Take it easy.
This is very awkward.
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
What are you doing here?
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
It's kind of dark -
See you later -
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
What's up, Walter?
Is it murdered man?
Are you ready?
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
Of course I do!
- even though Leonard's always asking you to go out with him and I - just -
Walter...there's...
Walter...stay away from me!
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
What did he say?
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
The question is what are you going to make next, Walter?  Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet?  How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
A show?!  Like this Sunday?
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
Police officer.
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!
Maxwell.
Hi.
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
I won't say good luck, Walter.
It's like...you've turned on.
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
Well, I'll go home with you.
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!
I don't think this is gold.
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
I... feel.... pretty.
Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
Oh, my God.  Is that true?
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
Something like that.
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
Come on, what was it?
Hey there.
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
I don't understand.
No, you didn't.  When?
You broke up with my machine?
Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.
Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
Is that your car?
You want some water or something?
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
Leave me alone.
I crashed your party.
Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
Like what?
You were supposed to be here at three.
Excuse me for having something important to do.
Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
Why?
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
I was a slave.
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
All right.  What do we do now?
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Oh, him.
What?
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
No -- you don't have to --
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!
You are such a wet.
Five?
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
All right.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
Omniplex?
Cool!
Oh, yeah!
Ah, you'll be coming back.
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
How was that?
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
Just till I lose.
I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
I'll tuck you in.
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
I knew it--you're seducing me!
I think you're real cute.
After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
But you were pulling your hips last night.
Damn.
Crash...I want you.
And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
Ninety-five miles an hour.
No ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.
Good--then listen.  "I sing the body electric.  The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them--"
Will that work for me?
I got him on the knee!
He did know.
What do I got?
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
Party without me.
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
I was playing naked.
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
What do I gotta do?
I'm trying to thank you.
Good.  Good.  That's terrific...
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
Nuke--  Good luck.
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
Step outside, pal.
Take the first shot at me.
I'd kill ya.
Don't try me.
We fight, she gets the clown-- how's that happen?
She's playing with my mind.
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
Little high.
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
Eight and twenty-four.
Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
What'you want, kid?
Well, I'd rather not say.
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
You were wandering around.
You were in the m- You were in the building.
You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
No, you're not calm.
Oh, good.
Stop -
Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing.
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
Oh. Have a good day at school.
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
Yeah.
Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
What?
All right, Ace?
You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.
...very difficult to get in.
You should say so.
Just say so.
All right, fine.
...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
All right.
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
What - what, Caesar's?
...hundred yards further down the road.
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
How'd you know I was here?
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
You've got to stop her.
Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff.
I-I'll do it.
She took care of the dealers...
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
Understand?  I'm sorry.
You're with me now.
Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  Put your arm in there.
Why do you need that much?
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
Huh?
You can't make me stop caring...
You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in...
It's under...
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.  But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense.
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
Take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
You threw it away?
Oscar wants you to call him.
To the Riviera.
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
I mean, it could get us both killed.
Oh, sh-
Fuck you.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
I wouldn't -
Now you need approval from him to go home?
You come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
Don't you threaten me!
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
I'm afraid to let her in the house.
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a
...Well, I've got a large family.
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
Yeah, okay.
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
Excuse me.
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
When I left here with the money...
Yeah.
I don't want to go to Europe.
What expenses?
You gotta go back out there.
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
Fuck you! Fuck you!
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
Is that what you did?
It's instinctive, you know.
Carmine left?
We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
I can see that. Sure.
Listen, Ginger... you know, this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace.
He gives a fuck what I do?
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
What? What?
Yes, you did.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
No, he's not.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
Yeah.
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
Great.
...same outfit.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
All right.
Yeah.
Do you know that?
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
He's sittin' by the phone -
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
Hey, how you doin'? 
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is Nick.
...Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
Fine. Everything's goin' good.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
They're havin' a good time too.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Calm down, calm down. Shh!
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
No more fuckin' dirty work!
Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
Tony.
How you doin'?
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
Again!
That's enough.
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
I know it, I know it.
Take it easy, though.
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
Hi.
Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...
Works for me.

Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
Hmm. Not bad.
Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff.
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
Women, huh?
Selina, are you okay?
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
"Dat's gotta hurt!"
Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
What a "drag."
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
Car wash, Captain?
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
Hello, Spooky.
How much?
Oh the hand--my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender and..You know, I realize I've never officially introduced myself...I'm Lewis Lane.
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
You are...
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
Maybe.
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
You seem sad, Spooky.
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
Nice breasts.
I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
Have you got to tell her your life story?
What if they do question the authenticity?
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
How do we get back to the freeway?
I told you I should've cuffed him.
I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye!
If you know that just back off.
And stop with the directions.
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
Lose the hardware now.
Any minute.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
Stop throwing names at me.
What do they need her for?
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
26th off Wilshire.
Why isn't anyone answering me?
Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
What do you do for a living?
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
Lenore, I'm here.  I'm getting out.
Does she wear glasses?
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?
I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.
Do you know what's in that box?
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
Can you walk?
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
You, I would've noticed.
You were at the Emerald that night?
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
Some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me.
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
Twenty percent.
You're making it too easy.
What time frame have you got in mind?
I'm here.  Where are you?
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
It's in the process.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
Seems like it.
Yeah.  Why don't we?
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
Yeah?
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
The 405 is coming up.
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
Just cut his hair, you know.
Good thing in a man.
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
Fuck it, is what I say.
You fucking promised.
Sure, Dave --
No, of course not, she's a lady.
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
Who?
And what's it like?
You old-fashioned?
What was that?
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
Give me that look again.
Piss off, Dave!
As different as it's possible to be.
Are you jealous of him?
You mean that?
Why?
The thing is, can you go the distance?
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
Made me feel all funny inside.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
I should have known, shouldn't I?
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
There's Dave. He knew too.
Am I becoming repetitious?
Don't ask me in.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
Come on.
Come on.
She from Scotland too?
You said anything, Dil
You promise?
Told you to stay in the hotel!
So tell me.
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
Are you all right, Dil?
Good-bye, Dil
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here
And you'll never leave me?
Dil!!!
Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon --
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
What was it?
You don't know that.
Leave us, Judie.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
So you did fuck up.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
Of course. I forgot.
And what if I say no?
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
Dil!
Give him a cup of tea.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Hope not.
Eat something, would you?
How did you know it was her?
What do you know about my nature?
Didn't look like that to me...
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
Never.
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
Now put it back in.
See? I was right about you.
Where would you most like to be now, man?
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Having two pints in the Rock.
Depends on what you believe in.
Is it bad?
I didn't.
Don't know her.
What?
Don't think that way.
Go to sleep now.
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
Faster than cricket?
You stupid bastard --
Don't run off, Jude.
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
I said shut the fuck up --
That fucker's dead --
What are you talking about?
Oh!
Oh, you should see your face.
What's the matter?
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
Reggie -- please believe me!
I said, tell me to go to the --
Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
Ours.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
No.
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
What's your first name today?
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
You'd lie about anything.
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
How long do you intend -- ?
Not my room!
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
Your --
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
Does it hurt?
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
What are you doing?
But I'm not through complaining yet.
They've got Jean-Louis!
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?
I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
Why don't you shut up!
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
Yes.
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
Peter Joshua.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Good for you.
Please, not on my account.
Yes, but we're divorced.
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
How did you find out?
Instant divorce you mean?
Hallo, Peter.
I'm still having trouble with English.
What was all that?
What are you doing in here?
Peter -- are you all right?
So they think he left it with you.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?
He knows everything.
Have you no idea who could have done it?
What's he up to?
I'm glad. But what's all this?
I don't see him.
Yeah? What's that?
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you?
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
What do you mean?
No honey.
It was a she.
You know her?
Who is she Daddy?
No!
Is Jody still awake?
St. Michael's.
Can you get inside?
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
No.
Really?
Your brother told us.
Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
But I shouldn't shut it down?
Pay no attention to me.
I am.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
of COURSE. You're not scared?
Then you should go.
Mark Shale.
The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
Someone tried to kill me.
You ok?
Especially not your dad.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
This place is empty.
Don't you think it's sick?
I heard you got attacked.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
They're not picking me up until six.
Thanks for coming back for me.
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
Kenny's aunt?
What?
Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
Let me just ask you a serious question first.
Unfair?!

Let me put it in easy terms, Aristotle. We are carrying a damn bomb...
Where do you want this stuff?
Since today.  New policy.
Uh, huh?
He could've called first.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
What did I say?
I need your truck.
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
You want cash?
I got, uh....
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
...up.
It happens to this piece of shit...
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
...-ed.
...the ice cream for money!
 
...-damn!
...work!  It's not even load-...
I did not steal the truck.
...waiting!
...Shift.
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
Get over!  Get over!
Whoo!
I made it!
What the fuck was that?!
Gee, you think so?
 Go on.
Yeah...
All right, let's go.
 Listen!  Listen...
He's crazy!
I don't want you to come anyway. 



Uh-oh.
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
 Yeah.
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
How wonderful for you.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
Listen, Arlo...
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
They're movin'.
Hey, just shut up.
Arlo, shut up.
Yeah.

...to him. 
Stop.
Hang...
What?
What?
What'd you come back for?!

You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
You, Arlo.
Oh!

Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
But...
Yeah, that's my truck.
...here.   Mason... 
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
Listen, deputy.
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
Whoo-hoo! 
...-bility.
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
Now listen to me.

And let me guess.  You failed.
Do you know what'll...
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...
Get 'em on line, then stall.  Long can't have gotten far.

This is it.
...comes up that road.
Carl!  Set up the camera.

There.
Shit.
I'm on it.
This river ends at a hydro dam...
Richard Long.
Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at...
We gotta get help.  Aw, fuck!  Damn.
....-lene.
Assumptions are always...
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
...should be right outside.
Hello.


Dead, last time I...


Oh, no?
Ah.
Rangers.
Sir, I got Taipei grindin' on me here. How long is this supposed to ta--?
Forty-nine?
...tight!
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
...-five.
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
...is a perfect hunter.
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
...back...
...fishin'.
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?

 ...miles. 
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
...you answer mine.
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
...to talk, son.
I said let me see your hands now!
...side!
Okay, doc.
Get in 

Gimme this god-...
Oh.
I'll stay here and secure this position.
It's too late, Mason. I've...
Negative.  Negative.
Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
How did she get that idea?
Oh yes.
None.
What for?
...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?...
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
What does this mean?
Haven't the faintest idea.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
Sure, as soon as we eat.
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
Yes.
Hello, Jake.
I'd like to talk to him.
No. It was an accident.
How do you happen to know her?
Isn't that your number?
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
What are you talking about?
Where?
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
No.
Mr. Gittes.
Would you like something to drink?
Iced tea.
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
You left your keys in the ignition.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
Mr. Gittes.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
Oh, yeah?
Never forgave him for what?
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
What about it?
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
The Albacore Club.
I know.
She's too upset.
What does it look like?
I can't...
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Katherine?... Katherine who?
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
How do you know?
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Oh my goodness.
There's just one question.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
He never even kids about it.
You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
You're a married man, am I right?
Mr. Gittes?
Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. Only in L.A.
The L.A. River?
Gittes?... Gittes?
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
Of course not.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Mr. Mulwray, please.
Apple core?
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? 
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? 
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
You weren't expecting me?
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
Did you ever see her again? 
But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here.  Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing...  I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic! 
Hey, Brad!  Brad!  He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never.  We would have heard.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
Three cents.
It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A new broom sweeps clean.
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
Go in and ask him to hurry.
Yes, very!  Naturally.
Who else you been to see?
Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic.  I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.
I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we?
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
Emily!
What do you expect me to do?  What in the world -
Have they heard from father yet? Has he seen -
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
You've got some on your face.
If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
Where's the soap?
Thanks.
A chicken?
A rooster?
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
How old did you say you were?
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
Would you sing for me?
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
You'll never have another chance to hit me again.  I never knew till this minute -
Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only we're talking now about what you are.  That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table.  I'm fighting for my life.  Not just my political life.  My life.  If your husband is elected governor -
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why don't you -
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
You goin', Mom?
Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
As Charles Foster Kane, who has 			eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you.  Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him.  You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.
I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles.  Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise -  this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year?
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
I'd like to talk to you about that.
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
Emily's going south next week with the child.  As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday.  When they get back -
Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
Hello, Brad.
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
Oh, yes, the bonus.
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
I'll sign those papers -
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
Mr. Leland, you were -
Maybe you could remember something that -
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
Are you sure?
How long have you been smoking?
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
That's it, everybody out.
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
You can hold me down.
Dick.
You're kidding.
Such a sordid state of affair.
Was I right?
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
He's not invited.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
Promise me it'll always be like that.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
With this guy locked in?
Who are you to make assessments?
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?
I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
You open?
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
So?
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees. He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday.  I tore up his membership.
Allan Harris.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
I guess.
So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
What's a jizz-mopper?
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
Don't yell at me, pal.
See? There you go again.
Design major.
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
What happened to all the Gatorade?
Oh, my god.
Jesus.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
You know.
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
What the fuck did you do that for?
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
Please, get the hell out of here.
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
Now I know you're lying.
You're kidding.
What happened to title dictates behavior?
Who eats cock?
She said she did all the work.
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
Am I right or what?
Like ten after.
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
He's got those love handles.
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
Yeah, but...
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
You're kidding.
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
What? What is that?
How much money did you leave up there?
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
Ooh! Can we?!
And I actually date you?
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
It better be up to and including me.
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
No; who were the three, besides me?
He requested this?
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
HOW MANY?
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
Hey! Where are you going?!
No, but you sucked enough dick!
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
That doesn't sound metal.
What part of Russia?
He really wants to play metal?
It's probably from being around all this food every day.
Really?
I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
You hope what feels good?
And... he told you all of this?
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
Willam!
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
Did you catch that thunder?
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.
Surprise me.
A monkey?
That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
Forget me.  If you can, get away.
What are we going to do?
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
Two...
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
That's a virtue isn't it?
You can stop right there.
Enough.
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
Resuscitation?
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
Gabe!?
Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie.
Take off and meet me at Eagle Cave.
Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
It was great.
Gabe!  Are you alright?
Can you see light?
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
Gabe!
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
We don't have time to argue about it!
He'll freeze.
Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
You said there was a way across.
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
What's your names?
On top of the peak.
Go after her.
Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
Why?  What are you going to do?!
Where's the third one, Travers?
Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
What did you do that for?
He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!
Come on, Alex. Come for walkies. Hahahahaha.
My wife... Alex freezes.
Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
But, missus, this is an emergency. It's a matter of life and death. Me friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.
So this is the young man?
Hullo.
Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, sir.
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
You are now a murderer, little Alex. A murderer, yes.
The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
I beg your pardon?
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
Good evening, my boy.
Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when I wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
That's right, Dad they did a great job on my gulliver, I'm completely reformed.
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
I'm gonna be sick.
Yes sir.
No, sir.
Are you an Epileptic?
No, sir.
No, sir.
The next morning I was taken to the Ludovico Medical Facility, outside the town centre, and I felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to the old Staja, as you always will when you leave a place you've like gotten used to. Chief Guard briskly leads the way for Alex and escort. They move into reception hall where the Doctor stands.
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
You've heard Beethoven before?
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Yes?
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
Good. What do you want?
And when do I get out of here then?
You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this ultra-violence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong. I've learned my lesson, sir. I see now what I've never seen before I'm cured, praise Bog!
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
Father, I have tried, have I not?
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
One shirt - blue, collar attached.
One pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
Sixth is faster.
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
Let me guess.  Clarinet?
Max, the cab driver!
You still carrying passengers?
Right through those doors.  The man himself.
No.
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
What if they're wrong?
...if they're wrong?!
Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?
You paid for my flowers?  They're beautiful.  Max, you gonna introduce us?
He's not paying you one cent!
Vincent <u>Farrell</u>, Assistant U.S. Attorney.  A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV...
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
You prefer nights?
You should start a union.
Like what?
Regulations?  These guys don't even give you sick leave.  How much you pull down on a good night?
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
I think he's dead.
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."
Max.
Try some deep breathing.
Get rid of 'em.
Who's that?
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
Vincent?
Jazz.  Music.
...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?
Max?  What are you doing?
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
Gimme your wallet.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
How long have you been a hit man?
You get benefits?
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
Would you have called her?
Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?
Who's Heller?
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
Head towards Union Station.
There you go...!
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
Slow down!
Well.  That was brilliant.
Max?
What happened?
The sound of love.
Are you crazy?!
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
You going to warn him?
I better get going.
What took so long?  You were in there all day.
More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
So I'm a little jumpy.  Who wouldn't be?
Equitation.
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?
Connecticut.
What about them?
Someone else might call it stalking.  My dad felt it.  He started carrying a gun.
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.
Liza?
Geronimo is down.
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
What's that?
Thank you.
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
You made your decision yet?
I'll do it.  On one condition.  I want to make sure she's okay.
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it?
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
A dog.
So, you doing anything tonight?
Go to the northeast corner.  Call a cab.  Bring the pizza.  Then there's a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.
Can I talk to you a second?
Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
We've lost contact.
There's no plug to pull.
He died...  ... in 1972.
Dr. Arroway --
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
I want you to listen to me, carefully.  The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.
Do you have a minute -- ?
... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
J39 Z186...?
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
Could we hear to China?
Could we hear to the moon?
Can you show me?
Am I one... or many?
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
Not if you think like a Vegan.
Some kind of circuitry...?
Why don't you come back with me?
I thought you were here because you want to go.
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
We could be together again --
But what about your research -- ?
But the work --
Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
Someone tell me this is really happening.
That you, Valerian?
I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
Champagne please.
I don't think so.
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one.  How did you do it?  How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
... as have all attempts at internal analysis.  We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable.
Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Lookit her bounce.
Go hard!
A salesman! Cool Hand Luke a salesman?
We saw the broads.
You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
Here's the Patrol.
You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
Lemme see it!
A cold drink.
A cold drink? Okay?
That's my baby.
Course not. He ain't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him. He's there 'cause he back sassed a Free Man. They got their rules and we ain't got nothing to do with that. Woulda probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. He's gotta learn the rules same as anybody else.
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
Lucille? Where do you get that?
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
What you mean, Luke?
You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
Oh Lord!
I'm in.
I gotta believe. Out!  Now they're rollin'.  King-five-four gets an eight.  Pair'a nines with a Jack gets a four. Ninas still up.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
Back a buck.
But -- but --
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
Stop that.
He'll never make it.
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
Now look what you did.
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be okay?
Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date.
She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?
Yes.  Without question.
I thought he was lying.
He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
I never hurt nobody...
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
Where is it?
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor impulse control.
Because of your phone calls.
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
Would you want to work with us on this?
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
How do you know that?
We'll show that to...
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
But it's a different m.o.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
Ruben.
Is that it?
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten.  We could use some help on the phones...
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
It's a woman shot in a car?
They all have one...
Open the door.  Please.
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
Michael Johnson.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko.
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.
I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...
... third Bay Area woman has been strangled, but the police continue to deny that this is the work of one killer.  Lt. Thomas Quinn declares that the murders will be treated as unrelated crimes, unless new evidence...
Detective Niccoletti?
We were together six years, sir!
Put in the Kevin Costner.
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
Where were you?
There, that's better.
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
Where's the car?
What!? They brought the car here?
Have you seen it?
It's about time.
I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
You haven't told me where we're going.
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
Are we allowed to park here?
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
Can you drive?
Crash victim?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project.
I want to see my mother immediately.
Look, I know he's almost through with treatment here. And, he's on medication.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
What about this one?
What's all the dreck?
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
Are you sure, Dear?
Mom, please.
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
I'm really not that hungry.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
Really, this isn't funny.
Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
A daisy for the lady.
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
Shocking, huh?
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
Where to?
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
Who ever said sanity was fun?
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
Something like that.
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
I guess we need to talk.
Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
I guess I should go now.
So, another one bites the dust.
I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark.
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
I hope it wasn't something I did.
Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?
No.
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
So will you?
What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
Who?
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
How's it look?
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
Where are the tapes?
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Where's your brother?
Hey Daniel! Hello?  Do you guys speak English?
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
Why are you here?
And?
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
Yeah.   We just go home.
Why not just steal another one?
Because you're the closest.
Bring me the scissors.
Do they come with batteries?
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
You're sure?
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
This is Zero.
It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
It's not your fault, Daniel.
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
Did you have to use that much explosive?
I've got a way with people.
I'm from Belgium.
And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
Maybe you should call the police.
I just thought that--
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
Hey boss, it's not a science.
They were all French guys.
Yeah, French guys from France.
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
What do we do?
There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
No.   How much?
You lived there. You know the city.
-- I want to be Elvis.
Give it to me, Sami.
No.   It's mine.
Mr. Zammito?
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
Algeria.
You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
I can't even hear myself think.
And how do we do that?
When do we go?
You ever hear of jet lag?
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
Did she break your heart?
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
She seems pleasant enough.
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
Where's your master?
Go ahead.
And if I use them to kill you?
You're home late... or should I say early?
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
You're already a thief.
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
You don't seem to understand.
This spells trouble.
You're doing calligraphy?
You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
No, really?
You say she killed a policeman?
I'll give them to you.
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry!
Lo?
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
Go.
What was it?
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
What happened?
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
It's Jade Fox!
You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing.
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
Could be.
Well, hello there...chocolate,
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
It's just the dope, don't worry
Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
Well, how's your friend?
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
You buying?  He kinda wanders around.  You'll see him if you pay attention.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
Top Dollar.
I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
What the hell are you?
Get it?
Your job is done.  You interfere with the living again.
...necklace... pearls...
An unexpected pleasure.
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
Got a boyfriend back home?
Why not?
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
Shut up.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
That's repulsive.
How are you today?
It was fine.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
That's also none of your business.
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
I do.
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
How am I a hypocrite?
Hi.
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
Why aren't you understanding?
Why are you trying to hurt me?
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
What do you mean?
Outstanding.
Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera.
What are the boys like?
Are you for real?
That was cool.
What are you saying?
He made you give him a blow job.
What do I do then?
But I thought high school is only four years.
Just a kiss, right?
What are you doing?
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
Don't you want to change that?
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
Hi, mom.
Oh baby... oh baby...
One.
What's wrong?
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
Sorry.
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
Jesus Christ, is she for real?
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
You can put it anywhere.
No.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
I'm at your service.
Who are you calling?
Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
Nothing.
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
You didn't?
Oh come on. For her first time?
Some other time.
It clearly is why.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
Well done.
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
You're too kind.
I got your message and came as quick as I could.
Not at all. What's wrong?
Hi. Is Annette at home?
It's desperate that I talk to her.
I'll do that.
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
Did she show up?
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
Hey Ronald.
I love the smell of pine.
What are saying, darling?
Mommy --
The Farren house
Oh, thank you, darling.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
I know that.
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
Something's haywire,
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
Ollie.
It's your play.
I haven't had my breakfast.
I thought you were with Amy.
That's the Farren house.
Amy, not that old tree!
Certain wishes do.
Can't you tell me later?
Now Amy
Just you wait!
Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
Will you be friend for always?
I shall want you for always.
Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.
I shall wear it in my hair!
You mustn't be afraid.
It's a pretty ring.
Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
But I only came to give back the ring.
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me  always!
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
Hurry!
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
Mother! You called me by name!
Good night, mother, good night.
I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
A dog at Victoria's Secret?
How have you been feeling?
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Translation: a total geek.
He's a very talented musician.
Do you really need these?
Where are all the mediums?
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
Maybe they have to pee.
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
Charming Carlton.
Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
Hello?
I've been here. What day is it?
Get rid of him!
I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
I think George knows.
Hello?
I do development for TV movies.
My apartment's just such a mess.
Uh huh. So pee.
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
Mark.
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
My mom used to get PMS too.
Like what?
How about you? Briefs or boxers?
I really gotta get going.
What are those?
I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
What's wrong?
You had a date with Carlton?
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
Hello?
NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
You at least owe me the truth.
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
Here's a towel.
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
We can get a warrant if you like.
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger...
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
It's for you. Frida.
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
You can't believe this bullshit.
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
How the hell is that your business?
You want her sheets?
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
I need something to keep me awake.
Mnunn.  Cold lately.  That night, couple weeks ago.  That was <u>real</u> cold.  Remember that?
What's he doing here?
Doctor!  What brings you here?
You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
Why do you want to speak to him?
Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  This case is very important to me.  Just a little warning:  I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
Don't know that either.
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
You see it?
I see.  The verdict, yes...
No.  I, ah...
Someones after me.
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
What does she say?  The woman.
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
What are you doing?
You're a liar!
What happened to you?
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
How much do you usually get paid?
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
Right and don't embellish.
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
.. Nothing.
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
... what?
You're fired.
Die, you pond scum!
Till what?
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
Check his kids.
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
It's a homeless shelter.
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
Uh-oh...
So you want to go swimming?
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
And who's gonna find out?
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
Presence.
What do you mean you made it all up?
Alan...
What are they?
... Sometimes they do.
You ever think back to how you started.
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
You ever use it?
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
You mean with you and everything?
I would have taken a bullet for I you, Dave.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
... . Ellen.
Oh... Yeah.
Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
You're leaving?
Where are you going?
How were you gonna get home?
You sure this goes somewhere?
Yeah.  Is that funny?
I know. I'm sorry...
They're crucifying you out there.
I missed...
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'.
Miss Henried, I think you better...
There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
This stuff really works? No shit?
I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived!
Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours.
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
Dios mia.
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
Where are you going, Tyler?
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
Step up here, Tyler.
You fired that shot, didn't you?
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
I'm in as long as we're careful.
Thigh man?  Mr. "K" was a hell raiser.
Can you believe it?  She was gonna call me!  She invited me to a party with her!
How'd it go?  Did you read it to her?
All right.  I'll try anything once.
Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden?
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
Oh God, it's over now!
Yes sir.
That's right, it's Nuwanda.
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
Nuwanda?  Please?
Yes sir.  We were just talking about that.
Do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone?
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
Hey, he's your roommate.
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
Hello?
Chris!
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.
I have to go home. Chet might call.
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
Good god, boy! Yell!
Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
Look at this.
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
So what do you think of my father?
So?
But if he said no before then...
By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?
Oh..
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
Who are you?
Right here...middle of nowhere...
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
Who gives a shit about aft?
Maybe we lost them.
I'm not staying here!
Now look what you did!
I'm not a thief.
Unless you collected on the insurance...
Noooo!
But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
You don't have to be so touchy.
Yeah you did...
So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
You don't take orders very well, do you?
Hanover!! Hanover!!
Shut up! You hear me!!
Can we use our indoor voice please...
What did you do the my kids!!
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
I mean...where is everbody?
I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
Don't shoot, man, don't shoot!
Who's going?
Here's to huntin'.
Damn right!
And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--
It is not!
I'm telling you, they changed it!
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
That's new, isn't it?
You're back.
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
No. None of that.
You mean...?
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
Not so good.
Sal.
Kind of. You didn't know?
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
You seem... disturbed.
Nick, he just came back.
I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that.
Promise! You gotta promise!
What are you, hoping?
Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you!
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
Great. That's great.
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
What?
It's Merle, Sal.
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
Cynthia! Sure.
How's it feel, huh? How's it feel to be back?
No!
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
Six or eight.  And they go wild?
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
Yeah?
Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
I want to see my wife and kid.
The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
You're working a partner on this.
Hello Wade.
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
Kill him... kill him.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
You okay?
You sure?  I can help you.
Are you a cop?
Got it.  Ejection seat?
Hey, buddy...
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
Sanchez...?
You should be in hospital.
Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
Demolition Man.
Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?
You could always take it off.
I'll take it.
Let's dance together -- Belle.
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
Belle --
Gee -- that Fair --
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
Never mind. What's your name?
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
Where's everybody?
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
Yes, why shouldn't it?
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!
Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.
Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
Down, Shep! Down!
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
Mary --
Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
Well -- I -- I-
Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --
But Jabez, I never said that!
Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary?
There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
Do you really think that?
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
My son ... what's the matter?
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster.
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
How 'bout some Christmas music?
-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --
The police...?
What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television...
I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?
Hans, he killed by brother --
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
You...you're an American?
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
New York...
Better than being caught with your pants down, right?  John McClane.
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
Yo!
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
Encourage them to be bolder.
After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief.
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago.  He said I could bunk with him.
I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --
John!
Excuse me, I'm looking for --
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.
You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.
Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things?
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
Yeah?  What's the odds?
Hey, you couldn't know.
Powell?  What's going on?
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I couldn't have made it without you.
Aw, hey...
You'll be okay.
...because you hurt me, God how you hurt me.  Can you imagine, marrying another man?  Did I do something to make you do that?  Did I ever turn you down, or anything?  The only thing I couldn't do, you're gonna laugh, is go on top - I got this fear of high places!  And I let myself get fat.
Hey, don't take the car!
Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry...
Jenny?
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say?
That's it.
These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing.  They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank!
Look... don't throw that on me.
They won't talk to you.
Yeah... yeah.
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
You alone, or you got confederates?
How many you got in there?
Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
Okay, give us the women.
Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.
What?
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
Here comes the FBI.  You men lookin' for protection?  We got all the police right here.
We're all set at Kennedy.
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
What's the matter with you?
This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!
Hey, you, manager... Don't get any ideas, fucker... See that man there? I bark and he bites!
Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. What is your name?
You got kids?
No you don't.
Yeah.
Mister Mulvaney?
What is it, Sam?
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him.
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure!
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
He's gone?
It's the cops.  Shit!
We'd kill ourselves.
First off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning.
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?
I don't want him.
Okay, who's the head teller here?
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.
Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll have to go to the toilet.
What do you want here, Ma?  You could of watched it on TV.
Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
I can't, Mom.  If I come out Sal will kill them.
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
<i>Well... I think that these are the gentlemen who robbed us. I'm also a bail bondsman out of Los Angeles. I can track down and deliver these crooks to you... for a small finder's fee of course.</i>
<i>Holy shit... this bitch is fierce.</i>
<i>They can do subtitles.</i>
Who the hell is that?
Alright. Time to ditch this thing. Did you take a look at the bathroom window?
Where are we going?
Bail jumper's name is Cookie Kincaid. Nineteen years old. His mommie posted bail when he was arrested for allegedly partaking in a drive-by shooting in Hawthorne.
You're breaking up... I can't hear you.
She's right... you lost your temper... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank. You lost all credibility right there!
Where are you? <b> INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN -- NEXT </b> Claremont is behind the Wheel of a BLACK CHEVY SUBURBAN. He pulls into the Texaco parking lot.
You motherfuckin' Tino. You fucked us so bad.
I don't know.
Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?
Take us to Vegas. <b> EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY </b> The crew rides in the back of the Wanderer's truck toward Vegas. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Domino stares at Taryn as she returns to the table.
Is that you, Domino?
The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
Cunt.
Cunt.
So who is this <i>Choko?</i> Is he your new boyfriend?
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
Don't fuck with us, Edna! There are at least three more limbs where that one came from!
<i>My real father was an actor. He died when I was a little girl.</i>

What did he say about the arm?
Get Cynthia on the line. <i>They changed the fucking font.</i>
Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
What did he do this time?
And I--we--want some Black people up.
You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?
You're a drunk fool.
I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often.
I hope the block is still standing.
Ten.
Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it.
And move to Long Island.  Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire.  Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all I got.  I'm too through with yar people.
D, not C.
How many you say?
Let it be broke.
It's Miller time.  Let me go give these Koreans s'more business.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
C'mon, Sal.
Whatdafuck do you want?
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
How much?  How much do I owe you?
Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.
Keep it.
Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years. Gonna take the day off and go to the beach.
Tina, you are too slick.
Shit!  I forgot.
And I really wanted some ice cream too.
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
You talk to 'em.
Smack him back.
You deaf or what?
Who's your favorite basketball player?
I didn't know you could read.
Dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea, pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano Pavarotti, Sole Mio, nonsinging motherfucker.
I'll do that.
Brother, Mookie, if I love you I love you, but if I hate you...
See, Pop.  That's just what I was talkin' about.  Every single time you tell Pino to do something, he gives it to me.
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive.
Pop, stop lying.
The both of youse, shaddup.
No, I'm not it.
You're it.
But I came here to learn about America.
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
Excuse me?
Wipe your feet. My parents are totally anal.
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
Just down the hall.
Hey look, it's our teacher.
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
I haven't seen you around here before.
No, it's a treasure map.
You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Yeah, go-cart accident.
Your mom made a move on me.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
You take that back!
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
Can he do that?
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
Nope. I was right.
Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.
Sorry about that Harry, first time I've brought a friend up there. You okay?
HARRY, can you hear me?
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
A raft.
George Washington!
You're it.
It's okay. I want the rush.
I made the polar bear pants.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Start the tape, Lloyd.
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
The one on the left.
You take her.
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
So can I come along?
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
What?
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
So, when can we do it?
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
Okay.
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
How was that?
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
I am strong!
God, I've missed you.
The evidence of what?
Where is it?
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto.
What's that you're saying?
Yes?
We have just folded space from Ix...
We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
What does she fear?  What about my Father?
Don't touch my mother...
He knows.
Man-carved steps.
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
Why do they come?
We call that one Muad'dib.
The Water of Life.
Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
You mustn't speak of...
Say, that's a funny place to sleep.
Uh, beg to differ.
Mr. <u>Lugosi</u>!  It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you.  Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL!
So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
But you're a big star!
They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
Is there anything I can get you? Water?  A blanket?
What is this place?
Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
What happened?!
Sorry...
This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
You really think so?
What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
Wow.
H-how'd you know?!
I don't understand.
There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
Dolores, give me your shoes.
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
But there's plenty of other parts.
You're a fuckin' mess.
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Dolores, wait!
I kinda need it now.
He's a <u>bum</u>.
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
Mr. Wood?!
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
"Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.
Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
So, Mr. Johnson --
I think you're quite handsome.
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
Tor, I should be getting home.
I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
Can I help you?
Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
Georgie, what's with the stag footage??  You said you were cutting in <u>establishing shots</u>!
I got married last night.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
So have you always lived in L.A.?
Did you find it boring?
Oh.  Okay.
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
Huh?!
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.
You're <u>sure</u>???
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.
Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.
Please, be compassionate.  I'm your husband!
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
How's your mother?
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
What?!
Oh, Al ... This is just...
You think she really likes him?
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
Yes, Ed.
They tore her dress! ...
Yeah?!
Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --
Ed --
He's who we want to go with.
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
So he killed himself.
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
He had girlfriends!
She had white shoes.
If I don't call you "Dad" it' just because... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives --  or when I thought you came into our lives --
I'm at the hospital.
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
Hi. Is Shari here?
What is she, at work?
I can't?
Our what?
What are you doing?
Are you asking me?
What does this mean?
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Yeah...
Why do it?
You do though, you look great.
What do you want?!
Really?
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Go!
What are you doing?
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
There's a list.
I need to talk.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
This is going right up your ass.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
Yeah. I service video equipment.
Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Why me?
You brought the girl!
... Ray?
Look, we gotta talk.
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
Quite a shithole, isn't it?
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
-- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."
That girl's an idiot.
I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
Sign here, please.
By the X.
You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
You did it at your house?  Your own house?
But you haven't written your novel.
what?
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
Having a problem with your eye there?
You're kidding, right?
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
Looks good to me.
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
I guess you know why you're here
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
What do you mean?
Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.
Hello, Mr. M.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Handles pretty good, don't you think?
So Tracy?
Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
Well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there.  But we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that.  Right, Jim?
Hmm?
And how did you get in the school?
I don't believe you.
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
Yep.
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.
Where 're you going?
Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -
Now could you leave me alone?
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
How'd she meet Patchett?
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
So you saved her.
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
Yeah, I hate them.
What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
He helped me out once.  That's all.
<u>What do you want</u>?
Will you work for me?
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions.
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl!
Was it... a rat?
Where are we going?
Yeah, that's Stens.
One in six.  Where's the girl?
How's it going to look on your report?
Why?
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
Bud...
You wanted to meet here?
Richard Stensland.
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
Thanks, but no thanks.
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
Should I?
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
What do you want to know?
Whose shoe?
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.
Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean.
More or less.
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
Dudley, we've been over this.
I... No.
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I --
Something like that.
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
Glasses.
Even I'm not that crazy.
Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
She is Lana Turner.
What's on the call sheet?
Decorated?
I get the idea.  You got a description?
Why do men and women usually see each other?
No.
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
Really?  What did White say?
Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.
I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
When?
On what evidence?
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them.  The free- wheeling, big-time Big V, celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere.  You like it, Jackie- Boy?
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
Shut up!
What happened with the kid and Loew?
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Pacific Coast Bell.
Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett.
Really?  How?
Working whores with squad two.
What happened?
DePinto's dead.
And you were the last one to talk to him.
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
No one. But I'm a little nervous.
Yes.
What <u>is</u> that?
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
I don't know what that--
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.
That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
What do you think?
The NSA killed him.
Here?
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
Gimme that.
You're driving.
Goddammit--
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?
Who's calling?
--Don't think it could've gone any better. Tell me, how's Deb? How're my grandchildren?
I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
For that matter, I think you will too.
Because my life is being ruined.
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
Anything at all?
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
It's not true.
You <u>swore</u>!
I know, but listen--
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
Good.
They're saying you killed that policeman.
Is it over?
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!
I know.
What makes you think it's you?
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
Otherwise you may have to what?
Your shoe.
Bobby--
Well that's why I'm here, Mr. Dean. 'Cause you're a labor lawyer.
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
Robert--
Some of 'em.
Sure, go ahead.
Where've you been?
Ssh!
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
Bobby? Piece of advice?
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
Yeah.
You think there was a connection to--
What's your opinion?
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
What happened?
What about the tapes?
Am I to understand--
Who?
He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
Yes sir.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
Federal Express?
Yes?
No thank you.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
Actually, you sing.
You should come into the shelter.
Shall we be all right?
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
I'm impressed you can sew.
You sew very badly.
This is - what is this?
It's beautiful.  What's it about?
I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
It hurts too much.
Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.
Have you seen Katharine?
It's Geoffrey under this.
I see.
Do you have your papers, sir?
If I could just see some identification.
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.
David Caravaggio.
Is this you?
Yeah, for a while.
I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
It's a week.  We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
Where did you find that?
Buon' giorno.
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.
Have a drink.
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England.
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.
Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
I can see my wife in that view.
Could I have a cigarette?
Excuse me -
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
No. But he hands them over.
Kip - come and dance with me
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
He's gone, hasn't he?
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever you and Lieutenant Singh
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Pardon me?
I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private.
I was looking forward to this evening.
What's happening?  Am I needed?
You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
I'll come with you.
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
What about your rank or serial number?
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
You don't call, you don't write.
I can't?
You disappeared.
Are you...okay?
I've got something...
Do you mind?
Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?
Oh?
He says they turned the card down.
What the hell do I do now?
Motorcycle.
What about your bags?
Lose something?
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
I go in alone.
Someone was expecting that.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
Let's do it again.
That's it. We're ready.
You bought this for me?
To us. To the Mask.
You were afraid of heights?
Camera in the--
One, two, three...
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
Careful...careful.
We did it.
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
The big job.
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
You've got everything planned.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
Well...What are we doing?
The eight billion. From them to us.
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
Hang on.
They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
Gin, really.
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.
Call it an expression of trust.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
What's she doing here?
Fax these to this number, okay?
Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your ex-husband helping out?
How does someone get meningitis?
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
All I have is hundreds.
Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --  I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- I'll check back in a bit.  Sorry.  My kid --
What are you doing here?
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
What medical records?
I didn't see any medical records in there.
Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
This is the only thing you found?
Then I don't get anything either.
Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
You think there's more?
You wanna talk about --
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
Hey.  I like working with you.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --
What kind of things come up?
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
Why not?
What is that?
When'd they file the demur?
How many counts?
Who's the judge?
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
So that stuff -- it kills people.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
County water board.  All righty, thanks.
I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
You've been reading for hours.
God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Annabelle Daniels.
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
What're you doing?
Great.
You're not nothing, Erin.
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?
I don't do favors for you anymore.
They up?
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
What time is it?
I'm embarrassed.
What?
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Oh.  Oh.
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.
I can't ...
You must survive, Luke.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
Howls.
Well, it's been awhile.
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
Mine, mine.
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
Yes sir!
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
Captain Solo.  What's the situation?
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
We?
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
Would it help if I got out and pushed?
Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
You don't look angry.
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
Are you crazy!
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
I see it Chewie, hang on.
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
Are you kidding?
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
What about Leia and the Wookiee?
Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
What about Han?
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
What?
Someone's falling.
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
Closer?!
The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.
Jabba the Hutt?
I don't believe it.
I see a city in the clouds.
Will they die?
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
Yes, My Lord.
Zira, are you mad?
His reactor's starting to overheat.
Ooww!
Where is he?
I thought he was, but he came back.
He's... near.
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
I need a favor.
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
I'm already dead.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
I don't know, sounds thin to me.
Shut up, Plissken.
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
I'll need to know more about this thing.
Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.
Locked.
Plissken...?
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?
Me too?
I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
All of us?
My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur cannot be lost. Other men--
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
Thanks to God, you are alive.
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table.
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
How? Where?
At your service, sir.
Yes.
I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives.
--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
I cannot offer you the land, only my love...
It didn't hurt too much, did it?
I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.
Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.
Who does it serve?
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
You are truly magnificent!
Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words.
I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.
It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
Well why are they tearing the building down?
Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.
No, he's working on another book.
It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
What's Burke got to do with it?
Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?
Oh, she'd love it.
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
Thank you.
There is nothing.
Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
How are you today?
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor.
She used those words?
We still think the temporal lobe...
Are you sure?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
That's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
Where?
You've been playing with it?
Wait a minute you need two.
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
Where'd you get it then?
Do you like films?
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it.
Do it again.
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.
Is that too tight?
Save your servant
Let the enemy have no power over her.
The Lord be with you.
What is it?
You're not my mother!!!
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
Who?
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
Who is it?
Is it Captain Howdy?
I'm afraid.
What're you saying, Charlie?
Maybe next time.
Honey ...
What's wrong with them?
Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident.
What's the gig?
Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.
Jack.
What's wrong with it?
Don't make trouble, all right?
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
What do you think?
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
No, I mean it.
Your older brother.
Frank?
Nice, huh?
A gust of wind killed him.
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
Get out of here!
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
You all right?
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
I thought we had separate rooms.
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
You leaving that on?
How's it coming?
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
What're you doing down here?
They were simple songs.
I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
Be reasonable, Jack.
Cancel, Frank.
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?
You don't know?
Stay off it.
I didn't hear you come in.
Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have that drink after all.  What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory.
How're your hands?
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
Charlie called.
Actually, that's my stage name.
What do you mean?
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
I sing now?
It's orange!
I wear a seven.
Oh, thanks.
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
The switch.  Hit the switch.
Fucking.
I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.
You two could play checkers.
I don't believe it.
Huh?
How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
Is that important?
How come?
Thanks.
Barker.  Jock Barker?
They never do, Mr. Barker.
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
Forget it.
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
Can't sleep?
It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
What'd I say?
You were good.
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
The both of them?  In there?
Oh. So what's it doing here?
I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
Vegetables.
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Older than me.
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
Merry Christmas, Jack.
Big piece or little?
None?
Do I look wasted -- asshole?
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
Why would he need more?
Or reactivated the first one.
What do you mean?
I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
For being one helluva guy.
... I was dreaming ...
Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
Who is this?
Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
Which ear was it?
Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?
Now what?
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
It can't be.  It's impossible.
What -- what are you doing?
Jamie ...
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
Screw your boundaries, Janie.  You have something I want.
Clarissa left those here.
When did you start smoking?
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
Castor's escaped!
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
What is with you tonight?
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
What's on your mind?
Nothing.
I'm going to the powder room.
You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?
Kate Reynolds...
Hello?
Mr. Mintz.
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
Take you, for instance...
This is day care.  Its where babies go when their parents are at work.
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Were friends, arent we?
What am I saying?  You dont need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, thats all.  Is that you?
Wheres your follow through?  Wheres your stance?
She said that?
I dont care if youre Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still cant park here.
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Yes you do...
Like I said, it's a business deal...
Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
Yeah?  What do you need?
Miss me, Jack?
No?  Cmon, Jack...Ive got everything I need, I dont have regrets, thats just not for me... sound familiar?
You?  What about me?  Im working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of em take a couple seconds...  ...some of em take a lot longer...
Do I look like I need your money.  It doesnt work like that and I cant tell you why.
Are we...?
Are we finally being honest?
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
Why dont you let me take this one, Kenny?
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
Go. Im sorry, you should just go...
Jack...dont even start...
Jack...
Uh...that babys crying...
How can you do that?
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
Look, Im sorry.  Im sorry I was such a saint before and Im such a prick now.  Maybe Im just not the same guy I was when we got married...
Well...Annie for one.
I think it worked out okay, dont you?
Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her.
You mean this chocolate cake?
Cmon.
Thank you...
Jack.
Heres the thing.  I really hadnt planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversarys good all day...
So whats the big surprise? You didnt rent this place for the weekend, did you?
No...
Not by a long shot.
Last night was great...
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
Ill go for a cup of coffee!
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
I'm not really dressed for a party.
Those yours too?
What about his first born?
Can't do it.  I cannot do it.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
We had a tough year.
You got a chisel round here?
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
Where...where am I?
Reed? ... Sue?
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
Deb... It's me.  I need you to step out front.
I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them?
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
What is that <i>thing</i>?
You're really cramping my style here.
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
I'm driving.
Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
I, uh, think I remember the number.
You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
For science.
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
What are you doing?
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
I found a broken gasket, from space --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
You said it was urgent.
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
I don't mean to be inquisitive. But this <CMDF> -- for all I know it could stand for <Consolidated Mobilization of Female Delinquents>?
General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it.
Trip? Where to?
That's beside the point now.  I don't see the sense of going on.
What is it?  Anything wrong?
He's making a fine recovery.
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
Shouldn't you answer that?
Open it! Open it before they get here!
Such as?
Doctor, what's wrong?
What can we do?
Don't tell me they're refueling...
"Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- "
How does it look, Doctor?
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
About forty miles an hour.
There it is!
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
Looks like somebody declared war.
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
All in all, quite a canoe...
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
What happened?
What's wrong, Skipper?
Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it.
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?
...So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd.
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
Where is Pancakes Hause?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
Shut the fuck up or I'll throw you back in the trunk, you know.
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
She started shrieking, you know.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
We need more -
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Yah, okay, but, uh -
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
Yah, he -
Oh, don't be silly.
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
The numbers y'asked for, calls made from the lobby pay phone at the Blue Ox. Two to Minneapolis that night.
Where you girls from?
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
I'm talkin' about your potential.
Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.
We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
Ya know, they said no one listenin' in, they'll be watchin', ya know. Maybe it's all bull, but like you said, Stan, they're callin' the shots.
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
Yah, real good. How you doin'?
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
Dammit! I wanna be a part a this thing!
No, see -
Well, that's okay, I just -
Hiya, Lou.
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
There's two of 'em, Lou!
Yah.
You look in his citation book?
...Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.  Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number.
Yah, that's a good one.
You're livin' in Edina, then?
...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
Yep.
Hello?
...Hello?
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
Hon?
...How's the paintin' goin'?
Yah, okay. How's the hotel?
...So?
It's just the three cent.
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl.
I'm tellin' ya.
What... ?
There's no one else here.
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
We need to talk.
The dynamite...
No, you can't die of insomnia.
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
You're kidding.
That's your favorite, too?  Tried to slip it by me, eh?
Where have you been the last few weeks?
I'm just on my way out...
This could go on for hours.
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
It's time for you to leave.
Where?  Here?
Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.
You... don't have to... leave.
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
I don't understand.  Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?
The Paper Street Soap Company.
Yeah?
You got about thirty seconds.
What?
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
Why are you doing this?
What happened... ?
My God, you're shot...
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
Thank you.
Well, uh... great.
I don't... think so.
Don't I?
Yeah.
I don't follow...
Can I stay at your place?
A nice, big cock.
Go ahead.  Say it.
I don't know about this.
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
Same here.
Where's your car?
Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
You?
I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?
You're sure?
Hey... don't knock librarians.
What?
You want to finish her off?
Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand.
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
Tyler...
I feel sick.
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
I'm not asking you to.
I don't know!  Nothing!
Why did you do that?
Why do people think anything?
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
No!  This isn't true.  We... we were around other people, together, both of us...
She's... you... you're fucking her.
...stop me?
...to let this happen!
If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
Yes...
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
You want out?
Ask me nicely.
What?
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
You have to tell us now.
What did you see?  What am I looking for?
What do you want me to do?
What did you see?
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
Um, Clear?  I'm sorry...about before. I...
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
You've made your point.
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
Please.  It's not going to wait.
What?
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
What's going on here?
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
You mean Alex Browning.
It throws the entire Death list out of whack.  And a new list has to be rewritten from scratch.  We all start over with a clean slate.
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
You can't cheat destiny.  I know what I have to do to save us.  I have to die.
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
I mean it.  Take care of it.
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
No.
I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
You guys are real... aren't you?
What's that?
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
... to target at Ban Kia Na.  We probe the site...
No radio source.  Nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on.
You okay?
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
I was in the brig.  They gave me a deal.  I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19.  He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.
I've seen worse places.
What's this stuff on the rice?
Are they going to torture us?
I'm Rambo.  This is Brewer.  Her name is Co.
Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
I do?
What's the job?
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
All this is for us?
How long before you're fully on line?
It's not necessary.
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
Congressional Medal of Honor.
We left some people behind there, John... POWs.
What?
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
Oh, no..I have to get home...
Most men are.
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?
Can I have my desk please.
I... You're not going to understand this.
See, I told you!
You're kidding!  What did he say?
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
Can I help you?
I wanna go...Just let me go...
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Remember. One chorus and out.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
Which ones?
Your name was picked.
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
So how do we do this?
I need a drink.
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
Where am I?
Where -- ?
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
That's O.K.
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!
Parry...
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
Happily married, probably.
Holdin' my penis...
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
I don't drink coffee...
I don't drink coffee...
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
I'm going on over there...
You like it?
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!
This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop.  How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?
Sure you don't want anything?
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
Can I get you anything else?
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
Robert Eroica...
I just can't look at you.
Sorry.
Oh.
Yeah... I guess so...
Maybe you better stay, then.
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...
How long have you been staying here?
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
You're leaving?
Hello...
Yes, intentionally.
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
Why?
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...
Is that funny?
What?
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
Where are you going?
No, I can't...
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here.
Robert, do you mind?
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
What kind of doggy is that?
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...
No, I wouldn't.
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
If you want to call it that.
Don't fuck wit' me! Don't fuck wit' me.  My lawyer's so good he'll have you workin in Alaska, so dress warn.
Do you have a name?
Wussup?
Remember me, from the pool?
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
So you got a girl?
See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
Wha'?
Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?
I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her?
How does he look up close?
Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.
I think he's 18 or 17.
Like this?
Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?
You looking for somebody?
Who?
What she look like?
Yo, that's my girl.
How do I know you're not lying.
Hey!
First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --
God I admire you.
That's what he said.
I wasn't asking.
Hey you're really nuts.
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
Ask anybody.
That's two.
No children?
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Mrs. Smith.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh --  Ever serve time?
You gonna nail the chief?
Are you all right, Doctor?
Here you are, Doctor.
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
Read this, please.
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attach cases.
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Isn't that nice. Since when?
Has he?
Then he has.
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
Its okay. The cops did it.
Why are they after you?
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Do you have a passport?
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
Will you kill me?
Yo!
His bride. Cute as a button.
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
Who is it?
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Can I ask you a question?
A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
Who.
What are you talking about?
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
Don't worry, I can take it.
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
No wonder.
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
How gray?
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
Gummy and two cops...
More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
You'll have it.
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
Not really.
And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
Mrs. Stanwyk!
No, I ain't got you...
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
Did she tell you anything?
That was close...
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
So many assholes, so few bullets.
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
Thanks for the promotion, man.
Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.
I do it for love.
You're saying you need money.
Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.
Hello, Ford...
What an interface!
Three hundred.
A simple 'please' would suffice...
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
Are you okay?
I'm afraid so, you want her?
Nice left you got there, jerk.
This way...
Ick.
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
When you going to let me work with you?  Why you always fucking with me?
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
The point?
So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
What about Don?
Kill them.  Not quickly.
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
I'm still the king!
You're that guy, the private eye.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
Hi, private eye guy!
Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
This isn't music!
How nice.
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
You don't use shit?
Did they follow you?
Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.
Oh Alain!  C'est merveilleux!  Tu me gtes.  Je t'aime.  Attends, je vais te montrer moi aussi ce que j'ai achet.
Regarde mon pcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire trs froid cet hiver.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
Des Moines.
That's in France.
Yeah!
When ya go back on?
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute.
Same car.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
Yeah.
Oh, my God!  What is that?!  Why you showing me this shit!?  JESUS!  JESUS! Get those away from me!
Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted.
You okay, man?
Hey, bud.
How about a little of the King?
Damn.
Where's Johnny?
There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about.
Hey, bud.
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
No, I don't.
About what?
What do you mean?
I'm scared.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
Sorry 'bout that.
What'd you say your name was?
Dad...?
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
No wait, don't go!
Why?
Yeah, it's me.
What?  What is it?
When?
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
Yeah, you betcha.
Hang on a sec, John.
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
You all right?
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
What?
He took your wallet?
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
Please, Dad, just do it.
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
Sull!  What the hell!
Go in where?
John.  John, you all right?
Another rough night, huh?  That it?
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
Okay, lemme walk you through it.
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
What?
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
Are you a good cop, John?
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
The 2-3.  Homicide.
Huh.
Who the fuck is this?
Going?  How do you mean?
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
No more... I can't!
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
Breakfast?
Think you can figure it out?
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
Derek... stop.
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
No.  I got here just before you did.
Hi.
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
Please... be cool.
Got any good ideas?
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
Is that all you found?
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
Ahh, nothing.
Never should've let her play.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
You got it.  Just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
Okay, give it back.
So what happened?
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
Where'd you get this?
But what if they try and scare us?
Which is?
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
Yes!
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
I know who you are.
Everything going okay?
Ed...
I gotta get back to work.
What's the problem here?
Jesus!
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
Why did you want her body?
She's beautiful.
Why didn't you tell me?
What are you doing?
...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the station.
I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.
You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
A major prick.
He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
No thanks.
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
Tell me.
Right.
Christ...where's Rennie??
She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!
I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
Get in the boat, Rennie!
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
So, are you having fun yet?
I...I don't know...
I got you a present.
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
Can he really take us home?
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...
But Rennie...
You have to call the police...
I used to drive a taxi.
Big mess every time.
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
Elliot?
Say it again.
Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
Very dangerous.
You mean because What's-His-Name.
What happened eighteen months ago?
You say we go?
He carries a gun.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
Shoot him.
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
What are we talking about?
This could be it.
This could Pbe it.
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
Because we're completely mismatched.
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
Do you want to get some coffee?
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
What else?
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
See, Daddy.
See, Daddy.
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
Where the hell are you?
It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from.
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
It's the kid's lucky day.
Now that's a complicated subject.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
This could be it!
Then they lost?
They're my team.
I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said.
'm not worried about this kid.
Postpone. We have every right.
Why?
Yes.
What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
Yes.
This could be it.
What's good?
Oh. You know him.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
He wears a disguise.
Do you think he can do it?
Home.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
It is the work of untouchables.
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.
Enough.
You mean Gandhi?
Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
What can we do?
Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community.  You belong to a very important profession.
You're an ambitious man.
I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.
We need your help!
You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
They're sparing no one, I see.
Will you have a glass of sherry?
I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure  under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?
And that's the basis of this "Declaration of Independence"?
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
You almost sound like you believe that.
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
From what budget?
How often do you test, Director?
Surely you know what you have.
At least it's nothing contagious.
Good to see you're feeling better.
I have to know where you come from.
It needs work.
It's not too late to back out.
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
It's all right.
How was your evening?
Where are we going?
Where are you taking her?
Hello?
Thank you.
What do you think?
Yeah.
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
Not that.
Does it have a name?
Why are we leaving?
I can't.
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
I've got enough here.
Flight got you nervous?
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
--I've read your profile.  I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.
The name?  For the certificate.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.
Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
Feel good?
I guess I'm kind of...
I was going to fix you breakfast.
Yeah... I know.
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
You know how I feel?
It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
What about the bank?
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
If you don't start telling the truth... 
A man helped me open it...
Texas is a big state.
You're full of ifs.
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
You can't trust anything these days.
We better stick here till tonight.
I want to say something.
Sounds good.
Things can't get much worse can they?
What is it?
So what?
Come on, come on.
That's right.
No, I'm not.
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
Hope you get to where you're going.
Two.
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
You got it.
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
You do what he says, Harold.
Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
I got a nurse in mind.
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
What did he say?
You knew what I'd do.
I made a mistake.
A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
I want to talk to you later.
How were things between you and Frank?
Nothing more? Just another feller?
I call that regular.
I know him too.
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
How'd you know where I'd be?
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
I want to give you an Oscar.
Was it Albert?
Who set it up?  Eric?
How's school?
Oh, what you doing now?
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
Don't know.
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
Did they give you a rough time?
I'm staying with a friend.
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
You don't look it.
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
Now just a minute...
They bloody hurt me.
You wouldn't.
Do us a favour?
No chance of that.
They're friends of mine.
Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
Cyril didn't like it, either.
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
Scotch, please.
Eric told me of your bereavement.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
Gerald wants to see him first.
Bollock naked with his socks still on?
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
What's that?
Three hundred altogether?
Four hundred?
You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
They did.
It's not.
And it's not right to the customers.
No.  That's absolutely right.
To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
Should do something to them.
Yes.
Someone should rob the office.
How many leads have we got?
Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
No.
You didn't?
Did I say that?
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
Are you sure?
That's ridiculous.
I didn't ask to be.
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
Can we get some coffee...?
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
Yes.
I am?
He said he filed...
They stole...
You think they're going to catch... where are you going?
They aren't?
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
Thieves.
Did they catch...?
I want to work today, that's why I came...
Fuck insured.  You owe me a car.
Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.
The people downtown said...
You stupid fucking cunt.  You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars.  Six thousand dollars.  And one Cadillac.  That's right.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit.  Where did you learn your trade.  You stupid fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever told you you could work with men?
Would you come in here, please?
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
Shelly...
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
Of what?
What are we going to say?
Now?  Now?
No.
Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
Mmm.
You are?
What are you trying to tell me?
Excuse me...
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
He told me my share was twenty-five.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
Wait...uh, look...  Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it.  Take it all...  Take it!
I...
John: John:...my daughter...
You did that?
Eight units?
Fuck you care...?
How was it...?
Harriett...
...yes...
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...?
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
Yes.
Monday.
I don't understand.
You don't count Saturday.
What would have elapsed?
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
I told you.
I can't regotiate.
What power?
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
You cashed the check?
Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.
Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry...
What is this, your farewell speech?
Your farewell to the troops?
It went down.  I filed it.
Patel?  Ravidam Patel?  How am I going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs?  Where did you get this, from the morgue?
We had a slight burglary last night.
Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...
On your pillow.
You've grown so tall... so tall in the last year.  You're much taller than me.
Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
Goddamn bitch.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
What's 'cent' Anne?'
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him?
Ready, Frankie.
Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.
We were all upset about that.
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
No.  I mean, are you sure?
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
Why?  Why does he bother other Italians?
Within the compound will be fine.
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.
Where's my wife?
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
I want it met.
I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
Fifteen percent skim?
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
Yeah, but don't worry.
Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
...and the tape will be running.
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
Yes.
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
Does it feel like a boy?
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
Leave her alone!  You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.
Why too late?
Kay, I told you...
How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me?  You understand, it's an impossibility.  I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll feel differently.  You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you.  I know you.  You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I.
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
You said you were Klingman.
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
I know it wasn't me...so that leaves you.
It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.
Says who?
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
I want you to help me take my revenge.
I want you to settle on their terms.
We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family.
On the phone?
Are we going to eat or what?
He supports me.
What's this?
Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.
I accept your generosity...
Thanks, doll.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
I wasn't going to try anything.
It still hurt.  A lot.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
That is why he must go to hell.  I do not think it fair.  But God's law is not for us to judge.
It's not what you think.
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
What have you done with him?
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
Or would you prefer a beer?
They're just copies then.  Gotcha.
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
"Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest?
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
You went to university?
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
Do you mind?
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
What way might that be?
So we understand each other?
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
Good afternoon, Clayton.
I suppose you'd like the top down.
Is that really her?
Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?
Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
No.  It won't do.
I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
Can't say that I have.  Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume.
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
Uh-oh.  The way you look at me, James.  What have you done this time?
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End".  Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  "Journey's End" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned.
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Can that count as one question?
Oh my God.  What's wrong, Mr. Whale?  Is it your heart?
Mr....Kay?
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
How are you?
It seems she neglected to mention it
Fish.
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
Jesus, man ... What'd you do?
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
Sound it out for me.
You'll leave -- ?
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
What do you want from me?
What's wrong with it -- ?
Got it ...
Yeah.
So? Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways -- ?
You ever feel bad about any of this?
What about him?
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
Any word, Kip -- ?
Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...
You goin' home?
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
No...
Hey, Kip ...
This has nothing to do with any of that --
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
Hey, you want something to eat ?
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
He's gonna kill you -- !
You can handle it?
You don't think so, huh?
What are you doing here?
Come here -
What are you doing here?
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
Shit ...
I left town. I didn't leave you.
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
Slip it in ...
The alarms go off ...
Let me worry about The Club ...
You okay -- ?
What are you doing... ?
What -- ?
Whatever do you mean?
The hard part ...
Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
Split it up. Any word on Donny?
Why don't you leave him alone?
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
What do you do?
I don't care. Something's going on.
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
We've got to help each other.
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
Then you're safer in here.
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
What happened? You okay?
Don't worry about it.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
It's a fait accompli?
And Jimmy's in it, right?
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
Where'd you find such creeps?
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!
I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...
Did he say what they're asking him about?
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
Who's she talking to?
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!
Thanks, Chuck.
It's a way outta here.
Hi.
Is this a bad time?
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
Is that true?
Jesus.
WILL!
How much money you got?
Morgan, Let's go.
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
Chuck, let's go.
You want us to give you cash right now?
How'd you like that course?
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?
And what do you see?
You're in a safe place, Will.
Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
--Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is three to the K times--
Yes. Under two conditions.
Okay. How?
What's that?
No.
Then don't set up any more meetings.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
Yes.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
So who won the bet?
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
Jobs doing what?
You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--
Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
Hello, Sean.
Where're you going?
Well, she out did herself today...
I might understand that.
What?
You're getting defensive, Will.
Well, I can see this is pointless...
Probably not.
Yeah, I read those.
Yeah. Do you paint?
You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like "we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says "man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee." So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes "don't forget the coffee!"
Why not?
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
Where were you?
I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
Gerry says the meeting went well.
Do you have a soul-mate?
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
Don't give me you line of shit.
What?
I been there. I played my hand.
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
The wrench, why?
Oh, I know.
Don't fuck with me.
Which one did you take, Will?
No. Thank you.
Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.
Yeah?
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
I really don't 'date' that much.
No I haven't...
No I wasn't...
How was that?
I bet you have a great family.
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Yeah.
I have twelve big brothers.
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
I thought you said you'd show me your place.
How's it goin'?
Just for fun?
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
I know. I just do.
I don't know. I just feel it.
Why not?
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
What about your twelve brothers?
I just wanted to call before you left.  I'm takin' all these job interviews. So I won't just be a construction worker.
Take care.
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
Ready, Ma?
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
You bust outa jail, Tom?
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.
We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.
I didn't see nothin'.
Can all of you work?
Open up! We hear you got a riot.
Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that.
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.
Is it fur?
How about us? Is that the truth for us?
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
But we can still do it, honey.
Lookin' for a job?
You ain't got to get sore.
I never asked you!
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.
Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a minute.
What's the matter, Grampa?
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
Got any plants?
I got to get a lot curiouser than I am--with all them cops out there.
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with. He's gonna be a radio expert, ya know. Maybe he figgered to suprise us.
We gonna live here?
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.
Mad, Ma?
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
I ain't full.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
What is it?
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by. 
Yeah?
Tommy?
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
Well?
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
--No.
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
So, what are you doing now?
I want to be an actor.
I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
Tell me about yourself.
That's it?
All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
Are you going to the reunion?
That's part of it.
You met people.
Flowers. That's funny.
Which would you rather...?
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
How do you know?
Say more.
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you.
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
Thank you, no.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
Is that right?
Hello, Bob.
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
He's falling for her. Look at him.
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
I have scruples. Next.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
I bought a new rug.
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
I have to get my head back into my work.
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
How are you? How's business?
Why not?
This is Annie MacLean.
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
I thought you lived in Chicago?
Why didn't it work out?
Everything under control?
Show me again.
Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
I don't know any other way, Annie.
Fine!
Oh. You didn't tell me.
This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this.
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
You got everything you need?
Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.
It's me.
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
I'm sorry.
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
What if she doesn't want to go?
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
Yeah, what?
Yes?
No. I am a "tubab."
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
Where does this go, Diane?
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
What was it like?
Frank's a good man.
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
Good luck to you, Annie.
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
Mixed salad.
Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself.
That's not a question, is it?
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
You want to go down or stay along the river?
Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?
IT WAS MY TURN!
Don't be such a baby!
You shut up, stupid!
Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
What stuff is that?
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
She's rabid, but cute.
What's that?
Shit!
Right.
What?
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
Ta-da!
Damn!
Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
Well this hasn't happened yet.
How was school?
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
Talk to me.
I found it! I found it!
Oh, shit! He got me.
Yes!
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
He's not in this class.
I'm Crash Override.
Yeah.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
How?
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
Ready?
I can't believe they decided you won.
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
Any questions?
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
What the hell was that all about?
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.
You're late.
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
Brady!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
An accident?
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
How do we look?
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
Why not?
Honey, I don't think their home.
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.
Not like 'ol Ben Meeker do something like that.
We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.
What the hell did this?
What?
Had enough?
Can we go home soon Rachel?
What are you doing out here alone?
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
You won't look pushy.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
Hell of a night.
You look sharp. You understand?
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
Get the outside shutters.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
When he makes that call.
Something?
Is that him? Is that him?
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
Where's the radio?
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!
Jamie! Get away!
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
I don't want to.
Yes.
Go get me a beer.
I gotta go.
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
Ten minutes.
Exactly what do you need?
Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.
Okay. Later.
Not any more.
'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...
Laurie...
What about the bogyman?
Who is it?
She's washing her clothes.
The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.
If you say so.
I see.
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
Oh, good...
Hi.
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Yeah.
Wow, it's the red one?
What?
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
Mm-hm.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
Mm-hm.
And it's just in one ear?
Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
How ya doin', man?
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
Hi, Dusty.
Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One of his moods.  Although it wasn't a bad week.  He  uh, sold a picture.
Where are you headed?
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
Yes.
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
You've been very cold to me tonight.
Mm-hm?
They're fantastic.
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
No!
I didn't say that.
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
Oh, Mom!
Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought.
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
So you met somebody else?
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
You're just realizing this now?
Yes, please.
...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything.  I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything!
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
Yeah?
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
Ohh!
Go right over there.
Gee.
I want to experience childbirth.
Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
Sometimes she's terrific...
Yeah, can you believe it?
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
Boy--
Oh, God...
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
People change...you know.
Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Really?
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
Really?
Oh, God!
Oh, wow!
So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...
Hi.  How you doin'?
Thanks.
Mickey?
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
Boy...Holly...Holly.
Uh-huh.
I can't think.
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
You know why that is?  Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
Well.  Word gets around.
It wasn't my day.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
Evelda Drumgo.
You want to get married...?
You're ready now.
Then you tell me, then.
Hard up as you are, at your age?  Whadda <u>you</u> care?  Surrender.
How you doin?
That's right.
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
What else did I miss...?
...are they hard to get?
Hold up a minute...
Why did he come back?
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
<u>Do</u> it...
Where was the call from.
...sir...?
He don't like popcorn.
Agent Starling, would you come with me...?
What reaction?
No, no, of course not.
No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
I don't mind being the token <u>woman</u>, what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token <u>man</u>... who are these Warriors, our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm in the room with a fugitive felon...
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
A fellow with five fingers.
Yes sir, I saw it. 
I know you did what you could.
Just a moment.  Starling didn't...
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...
She threw a punch at a man on the team.
What is that supposed to mean...?
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
If your duty requires it.
I saw a man, somewhat <u>fatigued</u>. Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  In the middle of the day.  An old story.  And then I saw the clothing was <u>fresh</u>--therefore:  a man who dressed at <u>home</u>.  And then I remarked the new <u>wedding</u> ring.  And so:  the <u>story</u> gave me pause.  A lovely story.  A new, and a beloved <u>wife</u>.  I wish you joy. 
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
How could you know?
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
Darling...
I've left my <u>program</u>...
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...
In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin?
And you let her get away.
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?
You look lovely.
Thank you, Cordell.
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
The girl could use some help.
...which of us is free...?
...might I make a suggestion...?
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
Don't shoot yourself.
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
Hello....?
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
...a Dr. Fell.  A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
...a <u>liaison</u> position...
She must be something special After Dark.
Then tell me.
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
You said:  that you have "decided." That your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a "self- indulgence," and you are going to put them aside.  And get on with your job.
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
You think you're so...but you're just...
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said...
I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
Eavesdropping, eh?  Hear anything good?
Am-ber!  Uh...don't do that.
You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking.
You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning.
You look a like you could use a friend.  You know, I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that I...
Well, the first week of camp has swhooshed on by and I thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow. I think we should discuss--
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
Hey.
"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>.
I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice....
I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.
Sawyer. Guess what today is?
Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.
You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.
You stupid cunt!
Where did you get these?
TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
What are you doing?
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.
Killing her won't solve anything.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
Mute!
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
It doesn't work on small animals!
We killed them, didn't we?
Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
Your son's dead and you love him.
We're breaking up. I am out!
Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...
You're still not listening! I'm not..
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
If you'll excuse me......
You know what I want, babe?
Answer him dick!
Cool off, we're seniors.
The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
Come on! Sausage rolls.
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
Bye.
wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
He's the manager!
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
What does old Stew want?
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
 I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
You have it.
I'm so happy to see you!
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
That's coming along well!
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
looks startled at the outburst.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
Mummy!
Him.
This.
What?
John has fallen in love with me!
Just a couple more . . .
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
I'm coming with you.
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
Are you a dream too?
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
Hint. It's not a geographical location.
It's inside a moving car.
Pitbull attacks.
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.
Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
That was cold...
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
Do you know where you are?
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
Are you ready?
Wait... what the hell is this...
... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
You should give it to someone with only one leg.
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
He gives a good report and I walk?
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
What is it, five days now I don't see you!
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
He waited for you three hours!
The homeless!
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
What's the matter?
What is it?
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"
There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?
My father didn't have his shoes on when he... when he came here.
If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
You didn't... get it on with him?
Reporters don't have hormones?
I didn't ask him.
You test each one thoroughly?
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
So where are all your toys?
Any particular brand?
How's the new place?
I guess so.  I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone.  I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
Do you do washing machines, too?
Everything breaks at once.
Do you have a family?
You must value your independence.
It's nice that you can make that choice.
About what?
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
Baby, what is it?
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night.
Whew.
Honey --
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
<u>Now</u>, Neil.  Stop teasing your sister.
Did you hear that?
How was lunch?
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
How long does it have to be a new house?
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
Did the cleaning woman come?
The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes.  When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled.  I had cancelled!  Then I get back to my office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows <u>everything</u>.
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
Let's follow 'em.
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
And this -- is the master bedroom.
Even better.
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
Yes -- I think it is.
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
Maybe myself.
Thank you, Thomas.
As friends -- always as friends.
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
This cannot be.
How comes it your are not afraid?
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
I cannot stay.
Yes.  How did you know?
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
Where did you get it?
Then who's Russell Nash?
No.
Why?
You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
You're not an easy person to get to know.
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
I am stronger than you, Highlander.
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
How can that be?
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
Don't cry, wee one.  It's a better place I go to.
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
You should warn them, Sonny.
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
Bullshit!
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
You with the cops?
All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation --
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
Let me come get him.
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
He needs a doctor.
What the fuck is that?
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
Are you out of your mind?
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
I'm scared shitless.
No one's coming.
I'm not gonna leave you!
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's coming back!
You gotta pee?
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
What do you want?
I can't go without Thomas.
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.
That's enough.
Is something wrong with Jane?
I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.
She didn't answer.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
Let it go, Captain.
It's right in front of us.
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
Okay.
If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
I guess we each have something the other wants.
We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A.
Excuse me?
Who are you?
You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
I used to work at the Diplomat.
They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
Excuse me, Colonel.
You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.
They fired a rocket at us.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
Will you protect us.
Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.
Satellites.
I will see what I can do.
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
We must go to the Diplomat.
We are better here.
You will tell them the truth.
Let's go.
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
Holy shit! Holy shit.
The fifth room is your broadcast room.
They moved you from the Diplomat?
Perfect timing.
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Who did you call?
What do you want?
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
Your brother's here?
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
Oh, my God!
Paul, don't let them die.
This won't do.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
A car.
Please, please try one more time.
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
Out? Where are you going?
For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
I don't know.
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
It's complicated. But don't worry --
Not yet.
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
More the merrier.
Don't think it'll be a problem.
What?
Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.
If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
What's in there?
What is it? What's in there?
Hey! Where'd you guys go?
What's down there?
Pritchett, is that you?
Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
Is she...alright?
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
Thanks.
We can do it...
Price!!
It's okay, everything's okay now.
Don't think it's even an issue.
What?
...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
Then what the hell are we doing here?
-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
Don't touch me!
-- just not always in the sexual sense.
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
-- what...are...you...going...to --
Evelyn... Get up... NOW!
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
First time for everything.
Do something!
I'm ready now.
I think...I may have the answer.
He was right! Pritchett was right!
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
Oh, no.
Won't do any good.
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
Price!
Town records are coming up now.
What do these ingredients mean?
Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?
Don't play games with me, little girl.
She's down...
She says she's lonely...
Can I have this room daddy?
What's he doing daddy?
Why?
Mommy!
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
What will Aubrey think?
Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
Are you playing tricks on me?
What is it?
It just disappeared.  Literally.
A friend?
How are we doing?
Oh my God where is she!
Aubrey!
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
You're bleeding.
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
We'll never know for sure.
Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.
There's something in there.
There's something through that wall!
What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.
C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right questions.  There is something we can do but it will require great courage.
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
What?
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
I'll boil some water.
Every day.
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
Yes.
How do we start?
Yeah really.  I'm ...
Yes. 53
Not quite.  This wasn't here.
Oh thank God, you're dead...
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
Alex!
Cameras?
Did I miss anything?
Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...
Rio, Alex?  After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!
We're going in from the ground floor.
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
That was close....
"We all had our quarrels and parted..."
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
My life is not some deal.  I...
With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...
Did he mention the Mayflowers?
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
Anna, what are you trying to say...
"Messed around" messed around?  I know-- I don't want to know.  First base?  Second Base?  Stop me when I'm getting warm...
You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
I'm going to find out.
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment...
This doesn't taste like cappuccino.
Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
Way to go, Anna.
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
Get away from there, convict!
Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.
I can't believe this.  I'm in fucking Russia, or do I have to say, the fucking Soviet Union and I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.  I never thought I'd say "I'm just in this job for the money."  Sad. Any last immature quips?
Why does this have to be so hard...
The Hoopsucker!
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
That smart?!
I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
...Hello?
A sawbuck!
Ol' satchel-butt...
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
Hungry, anyway.
You're from Muncie?!
...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
Well, she probably had a deadline...
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
You can't print that!
I got big ideas, though!
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
...Geez.
Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
Wuddya mean, buddy?
Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman?
Oh, geez.
Yessir.
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
Ya don't say.
She's got other problems, of course...
Maybe he's wise.
She isn't!
What's this?
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.
-- But, you're an American?
As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  You'll have to excuse me.
I wish I hadn't heard --
Can't I take it for you?
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?
I heard about your little misadventure yesterday, Miss Connell.  On your first "day off," too.
Wesley can be very entertaining.
I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, "Paul, darling..."  The whole thing beginning all over again...
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
Considering that the paper is three months old and this isn't Sunday -- no thank you.
And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
An accident at the mill?
Investigation of what?
Well, Jeffries, why come to us about it?  Why don't you go up to the Houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and dancing -- that's what causes all the trouble.
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?
What?
In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it!  ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your -
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
Don't be dim.
That this was going to be a key party?
Damn it, Ben --
Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know --
I'm fine dad.
So how's school treating you?
Classes?
Anyone special? You know...
Holy! Well. If you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up.
Um, Paul. On second thought, can you do me a favor and pretend I never said any of that.
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?
What are you talking about?
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
Dad stop it!
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
-- 73
It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.
Thank you Janey.
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?
Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.
You want coffee or something?
Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.
I suppose. Why?
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
I don't like coffee.
Please don't.
How'd you know?
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
Reverend Edwards.
Flame on, asshole.
How can you do that man?
You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the Checkers speech stuff.
Huh?
And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded?
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
No one.
Geometry?
See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
When worlds collide.
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
How are the parental units functioning these days?
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
Her name's Libbets.
Hood residence.
All my model planes.
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
Just thought I'd stop by.
Well.  It looks like someone got to his private parts before us.
I don't know. How do I know?
Just after Leland Street.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
My partner...
Typical seventeen year-old.  She went to a party Friday night?
Duggar called him?
No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.
Thanks.
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
Who was the last one to see her alive?
We're sure it's hers?
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
I'll call him now.
Randy Stetz?
He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks.
He's asking everybody questions.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
You don't have to be involved, Will.
Fred Duggar?
What if someone finds out?
Did you love her?
How should I know?...
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
My arm!
Don't you pull that shit with me.
Where's your back-up?
You're not following procedure.
Your lips, they didn't move.
Who made us what we are?
Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
Then blame the one who made her...
Are these not the answers you came for?
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
Laudanum!
Why does he call you that?
Claudia! You did that?
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
It can't be -
Or her, or her - or any of them?
You know her?
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
Do you think I would let them harm you?
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
He can protect us, Claudia.
You want death? Is it death you want?
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
Did I hear a yes?
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
I know. It gets cold so fast.
The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
Read her thoughts.
Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
What do you imagine you are Louis?
Lestat, she's alive!!!!
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
I didn't want to kill her.
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
I have to go now Lestat...
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
You followed me here, didn't you?
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
You loved Yvette...
But why did you tell her?
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
Lestat escaped the fire!
No... it can't end like that...
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
What can I do for you?
Your what?
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
Say yes.
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
Oh, god, it's you --
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
I understand something.
Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.
Ray...what are you doing?
Never do that again.
Don't kill me --
You sure?
The shower again?
You sure it's okay with you?
Julie? What's wrong?
There was a body! I swear it!
...Why?
You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone.
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
Pretty cool bar.
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
You think that's a good place to hide?
Jeez, that's a full carat --
What's the matter, boy trouble?
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
We'll only be a second, okay?
Where'd Estes go?
You don't have to. It's inside of you -- all the glory that was Greece - the dancing, the singing and the white marble --
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
Goodbye.
If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
I hope Mr. Jacks gets to bed in one piece.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer  a correspondent of some sort 
You are fortunate in your father.
Cathy - how does it feel to have a father?
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -or just because he is one's father?
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
Thea, your choice is a very simple one. Either you want to claim him as your father, or you do not.
Why, I'm fond of Thea.
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
She is not there. The coffin is gone.
You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in - the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me  a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
I've seen men die drunk - and I've seen men die of the plague.
Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
Daughter -- my daughter --
What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
I don't think so, Thea. He has spoken of your mother. I don't believe he knows you are his daughter.
But they're somebody's children.
Get that ladder up here.
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
George . . .
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
By letting me help you.
What'd you say?
Well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
Where's Mary?
I . . .
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Where? I don't see a thing.
A boy?
Who is it?
It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
Hey, Ernie!
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
Well, sure I do.
Today, over at the house.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmm . . .
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
Well then, how do you know?
Is it a charge, sir?
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
No . . . No . . . No. . .
Oh, it's wonderful.
That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!
Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it?
What do you mean, and be bored to death?
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
Two cents worth of shoelaces?
Where are you going?
No, George, don't . . .
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
When?
George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.
Those Rockefellers!
Now look, did you buy anything?
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in  providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
Do I look as funny as you do?
Well, why don't you say it?
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
Ouch!
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
How's that?
About what?
George . . . George . . . George . . .
Oh, Mary . . .
Have fun.
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
George Bailey lassos stork.
Where're you going?
Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down and have dinner.
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.
Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
You forgot something.
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
For me...?
Wheee!  Faster!
When do we get to the lighthouse?
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
Maybe by now they are.
If you're beached, why are we doing this?  For practice?
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.
The lighthouse?
What is it?
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
Coming up!  Give way!
I thought you said she was going with us?
Tina!
It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
What about that camera?
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
I can't let you take her out.
Where to?
Do I have to?
Pop....
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
Mike?  Is that you?
I passed out, but I'm okay.
Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....
Let's see -- you got a minute?
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
What have you seen before?  This is nothing.  Seaweed.  Mud.  Some- thing in the lens.
There is nothing to discuss.
The what?
What makes you think there might be?
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
Let's get the kid home.
Mrs. Silvera?
You have to smoke so early in the morning?
Eat Cheerios.
No.
All summer?
Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Bullshit.
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you.  Proof!
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Where the hell is Air One?
Can I go swimming?
We're going to die.
Whoops, almost lost one.  Can't play with the dolphins without skis....
Terry!  You okay?
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
No class.
By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out.  More, with this wind.
Take a break for a minute, okay?
Eddie, can we do that?  Can we go skiing?  We can use my Uncle's boat.  Eddie?
Give me back my hat!
Right after, the Kids went out?
Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go.  Neither of you can go.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.
You do everything your parents tell you?
Faster!  Faster!
I don't think she's such hot stuff.
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
You're going out.
Michael....
Be reasonable, please....
Go on, Doctor.
Absolutely.  Good idea.
I'll need more men to look.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
You see the three-quarter socket?
Well, don't worry about your fiancee.  We'll watch over her.
How come?
And what else is bothering you?
It's his work.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
What do I do now?
Are you scared?
It's romantic down here.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
Michael...
After what happened to us?
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?
Fine piece of engineering.
Kathryn...
Finally.
Recovering nicely.
It's too soon to move him.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
Michael, you don't have to go down there.
Are you okay?
Go where?
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.
You can get killed!
I want that shark alive.
Let's hope he knows that.
Why?
Not at all.
I like it when they wake up.
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
A piece of pie on Sunday.
He's a young one.
Musclehead?
You were great out there!
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Take it up.
Take it up!
I don't talk that way.
Did you see that?
Yes, there is goes.
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
Polar bears.
South Georgia, Antarctica.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
What kind of trouble?
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
Can I make sandwiches...?
Where are you going?
It sure is good to be home....
You knew...?
Where is she?
Where's my mother?
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
You want to try your hand at something...?
All he did was kiss me....
Michael!  This thing working?
Stop that....
That....
The fish.  Check it....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
You're damn right I'm serious....
Dad died from a heart attack....
I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.
It's just like driving a car....
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
I'm fine.
You promised me a drink....
Would you suffer through a dance with me?
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
Want to go for a little ride?
Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
What do you mean, it'll find her?
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
Keep it steady....
I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....
Come on, Hoagie....
Matt?
Still tagging conch?
Stop farting around....
I know how to tag a damn conch....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
They won't fight with me....
I wish you wouldn't say that....
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
How long have you known Hoagie?
What's so funny about that?
We lost it....
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
I'm coming...How close is it?
It's my turn in the barrel, man....
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
I don't like the song.
If it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it'll shock the hell out of it.  We'll need a slave switch to set it off. Pull the dry cell out of the radio.
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
Who grows more beautiful....
You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow....
That man keeps calling about his training film.  I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.
I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
The van?
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
How's the new residence?
What does that mean?
Why so coy about the word "frozen"?
Someone bet me a dollar ..
Where is everyone?
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something ..
We're going.
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
She wasn't lying about the van.
That's a very stupid question, Ross.
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
Jesus. What are you doin?
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.
Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.
What do you want me to do, Chief?
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
Did he get you the job?
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
You don't know what you done, Taylor.
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
You must have some idea about him.
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
Can I see your hands?
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
Has he got your aunt's address?
Is that Margie?
I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
Who said anything about "loser?" Where do you get this word "loser?"
Now.
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
No one has ever dumped me.
Don't let him stay up too late.
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Now what did you lose?
Oh tsht. Yes.
And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --
That took guts.
Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set.
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Beer okay?
Me too.
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
Oh God.
I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
What about medical?
Wait. Where is he?
He's coming over.
I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?
Denver is where he should be.
I'm sorry, I --
Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing --
Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!
I got it.
At last I find you.
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
Rod --
The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
To the pools?
How can I make your life better?
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
I'm fine.  What's up?
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
Jerry --
Let's go the zoo.
Show me the animal, Jerry!
-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
Do you think it goes all the way across?
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
What did you say!
That's him. Thats Eric!
What?...WHAT!?
Sweetheart, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay.
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
PAUL!
Is it a rex?
We could co-write a paper.
We need to keep moving.
He used to know me.
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
How do you mean?
It matches the pictures.
Is there an antidote?
What?
What are you talking about?
I don't believe you.
But he's the head of InGen!
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
Is that kid still bothering you?
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
"InGen."  What's InGen?
Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
Dad!
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
Where's the power and radio setup?
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement.
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
Their what?
I think she's with Sarah!
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
Oh, God.
These formations.  They're dried --
That little black line?
Give it more morphine!
Hold it down, Nick!
WHAT ARE YOU-
We have to send someone to look for him!
Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
How long will this take?
What?  No menthol?
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Did I say jerk?
Carousel.
But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
Once we have control again we - -
Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.
Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Constantly sick.
- - a gizzard - -
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
Dr. Grant!
Do you see anything?
I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
I'm going with you.
No. We can't.
It's all right.
I know, it's very exciting.
Oh, imperfections?
Unpredictability....
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
Up and down, up and down!
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
I read your book.
These look kind of familiar.
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
So am I going to help you with your foot?
Straight-A brainiac!
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
Yeah, they hate me.
Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
Tim!  Lex!
They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
Why didn't I build in Orlando?
Sustain winds 45 knots.
I'm a hacker!
Fifty.
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
Two.
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.
What?
Who?
A house?
You watch this garbage?
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
It's as though there were two people in that room... both of them asleep... both of them dreaming.
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
-- You appreciate my writing.
The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
Well, I --
I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
Where you've been employed for seven years.
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
Do you?
Still, we're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings.
-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.
Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
May I ask where your two warders are?
"Raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
I could always apply there.
It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
Get the hell out of here.''!
What have you got there?
Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -
Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ...  organize an expedition -
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
I can't imagine you crying.
There's a light up ahead.
Give it back!
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
Man Eater!!!
Did you see her?
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
Did you fear for your life?
Why?
What's that?
Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.
A few more days. We know who did this.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
-- We can talk --
Honest?
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville --
Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
What? This?
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
Can't you get him?
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.
Is there anything more I could --
Spangler says we have a relationship.
Bree --
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
That who?
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
Have you discussed this with them?
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?
Not unusual.
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
Well?
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands.
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
You forgot the milk.
What about my orange juice?
Uh, huh...
You're late.
Okay...Same as usual...
Well, I see the Yankees finally won a game.
I'm sorry.
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
Then eat around it.
Daddy?
I don't think so.
Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...
Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...
Objection.
See.  That's my name.
Are you going to get remarried?
No, son.  Daddy and mommy will never get remarried.
Mom--I mean, dad?
Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Your mom.
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
And would you describe those years as happy?
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Objection.
Objection!
Objection!
No further questions.  Thank you Mrs. Phillips.
Objection, your honor!  Counsel is harassing the witness.
And did you have a close personal relationship?
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
Did he ever fail to provide for you?
How long was that?
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.
Where are you going?
I've seen him.
I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing.  I never thought he'd use it.
Only can I still see him?
Listen, don't let it get you down.  You're going to be fine.
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
All right, Jim.  You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right?  Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim?
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Hiya, Phyllis.  These are the Revlon contracts.  I thought you ought to check them out.
O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
How should I know?
Yeah?
What?
Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child.
Oh, Christ!
I lost him?  I lost him?
What?!  She wants what?!
You ever see her talk to the walls?
Mr. Kramer, there's--
Things? What kind of things?
Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--
What are you going to do?
How many onions does it say to use?
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
What d'you tell her?
Ted.
Hey, that's terrific.
Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...
All quiet?
Where are you from?
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
I worry about them.
Mama, my story.
And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector."
Where will you keep them?
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
Did you receive the letter?
Yes.
Holiness?
Me. First break of day.
This many?
Who am I?
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
Where is Alsace?
What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
Quite simple. Yes. Good.
What is the size of our army, now?
One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called "El Salvador".
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
I am scared.
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
Me?
What does the butter spot feel like?
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
We have enemies.
This is Britain.
This is Tibet. And this is China.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
You will not come?
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
Did you love your husband, before you married?
Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
It seems like we're getting lower.
C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
I might get a shot.
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
Was he a good man?
Promise you won't kill me, first.
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
What's that?
This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
And again.  How would you get him on land?
The more he thrashes, the better.
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
With crocodiles... everything's even.
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
Eh.  Fuck it.
What?
You're gonna be okay.
He's gonna live?
Did you make anything of the tooth?
In Maine?
Same thing from Fish And Game.
Baby crocs?
What are you doing?
Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
Thanks for the... bandaid.
What?
I'm not mushing it.
What?
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
Are we crazy?
Watch out!!
Well...
Different worlds, Jack.
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
You're sort of a rude person.
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
Are you alright?
I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
This is what we do?
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
<u>You</u>?
What'd I do?
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
"- every day."
Agent Starling! Telephone!
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.
Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
Miggs has been murdered.
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
Why?
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
What do you see, Starling?
When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.
You seem pretty sure of that.
But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.
If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone.
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
They said she was just rags, like somebody -
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
No, I came because we need -
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Ahhh... Why?
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
Yes.
Horses - and sheep...
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?
We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.
I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
Thank you, Clarice.
Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.
Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.
Yes... I did.
Yes, miss.
They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
Mr Poe?
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
What is it?
In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
You do not know what you are saying!
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
Yes. Go ahead.
... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
How far is it, scout?
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
Who were these people?
And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
That is the truth!
Head for... for the white water.
Where do we go from here?
I don't understand!
And if we're unlucky?
What did you say?
Will you men help us stop the French?
Got a reason to stay.
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
Sir!
We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
Gold could be arranged.
We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
You mind if I take a look at this?
The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
Why Sixpack?
Was there such a thing?
DeJesus!  A readout!
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
I thought they were your friends?
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
No.  I'm just being friendly.
You think I should hang around more with the crew?
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
What can we do?
What about our quota?
What's wrong with it?
Okay, number 23's full.
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
...as long as you know it's not in your contract.
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
You take your money, too seriously, Bo.
I'm telling you, it's the suits!
Still bothering you?
What's going on?
It's Sixpack!
Burritos...Enchiladas...
How'd you do that?
Getting some food.
How far away is she?
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
What is it?
What's wrong, did you miss me?
I'll kill him!
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
Bacon, see what we got.
Well?
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
There are no others.
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
Have you counted the money?
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
You all right back there, mate?
What are you doing?
What can I do for you?
Jesus, I have heard about him.
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
There's nothing in it!
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
Tom?
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
Go on.
And?
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
Look. Go on, look.
What's left over?'
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
The money, the gear!
I don't know what the big deal is.
That makes it okay?
How do you think you're going to make a living?
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.
Private Johnson, are you unhappy in the Army?
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
You're dismissed.
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
And you and Private Graves--
You know the popular version of how he left town.
You got a cause of death?
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
I'm not picking it up.
You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
You were in a fight--
Uncle Al--
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
So I'm part-Indian?
How's your room shaping up?
Yeah. He lives here, right?
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
Something like that.
What?
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
We been through this before--
I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
Treasure hunter?
Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
--warning. Not 'cause he had it in for the colored
Black Seminoles?
That where he was shot?
I gonna meet that family of yours?
Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?
You have somebody else out there?
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
"Mas cerveza por favor."
That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.
When we backed you--
I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
How 'bout the Sheriff?
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
Mami, how old were you when my father--
Right. When he was killed.
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
I don't think you can take it personally--
Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope.
You got in late last night.
Morning, Sheriff.
That's how I ruined my stomach.
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
Your mother still doesn't like me.
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
I mean what did we know about anything?
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
They got telephones.
How 'bout you?
Otis what?
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
You going to tell her?
Mister D'Amour?
Hello, L.A.
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
Why?
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
Right.
Who did this?
Who did this?
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
He's a secretive man.
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
Are they treating you okay?
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
Oh Christ.
Oh God!
What the fuck?
Bad show last night?
... they believe you.
Sure.
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
What makes you so sure?
You believe that?
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --
Then what do you want?
Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
What the fuck are you doing here?
What for?
You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
I like to know why things happen.
I can't let you in.
Are you satisfied now?
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
Him too.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
How the fuck do you do that?
Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
Oh Jeez.
Did she know where Nix was buried?
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
He did something with the ground.
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
Call me tomorrow.
Yes! Yes!
And?
Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
Of course.
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
Really?
Did I scowl at you?
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
Oh.
Four.
Do you ever see him?
Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
What do you want to drink?
Well... have a good flight.
Mr. Harris?
Mr. Harris?
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
Uh, no.
That's not what I'm talking about.
You know, eat healthier.
Not all that pasta.
Hello?
I guess she's busy.
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
Ok.
Hospital?
Hello? Yes?
Evelyn Waugh?
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
No, what are you talking about.
Like popcorn?
Will you please stop smoking?
I miss you.
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
I'm still shaking.
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
She's been stalking you, Peter.
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
You raised me, like a son.
You killed my parents.
Why are you doing this to me?
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.
And also that...
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.
What's that got to do with you?
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
We need to talk.
Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him.  What the fuck is going on?
Why did he try to kill me?
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
Yes, I know.
Do you know your parents' blood types?
Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry.
What are you looking for exactly?
Nothing yet.
Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
What about after?
What can I do?
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
He was trying to tell me something.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
Good of you to stop by.
As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
What's up?
Monica, what did you do?
Hi.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
So you're still breast-feeding?
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
What?
My mouth is kinda dry.
That was nice.
Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.
You might be the only one with a job.
A horse?
I found you someone.
This brother from my college.
And he's fine, girl.
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
But?
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
One, up.
For real?
My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
I don't know.  A lot.
I don't like flowers.
I want to ride my own bike.
What?
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
Didn't know you cared so much.
See you made it.
You don't look half-bad.
Hey.
Guess not.
Mulholland Drive.
What was that about?
Then prove her wrong.
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
Sorry about your game.
Who's nobody?
You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
Hey.
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
Just something I'm trying.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
What are the doctors saying?
So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
Tried calling you a couple times.
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
You visiting?
So...how's the knee?
It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.
You asked me what was missing.
From basketball.
You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
I'll play you.
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
With who?
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
What?
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
Later when?
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
I just told you.
What are you doing here?
Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro.
From your mouth.
What do you want?
Good.
Yeah.
Your teeth are straight.
It's been the same fuckin' thing for thirty years, Burt --
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
Wanna call me a slut now, something?
What the fuck do you want?
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
For what?
Wilson.
No.
No.
You mind if I check things back here?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
The gentleman who came to the door --
Just Jim.
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
Yeah.
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
It's fine.
Well.
I lost my gun.
It's ok.
It's ok.
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
What do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --
Let's go, c'mon, get up --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY MAN.
BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY --
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know --
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
Do you have love in your heart?
I have love.
I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me --
What is that?
Braces?
I've been a good worker --
Yeah.
How's today then?
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
She had cancer...from her...in her stomach and I didn't go anywhere with her...and I didn't do a god thing... for her and to help her....shit...this bitch...the beautiful, beautiful bitch with perfect skin and child bearing hips and so soft...her namewasLilysee?  He liked her though he did, his mom, Frank/Jack...he took care of her and she died. She didn't stick with him and he thinks and he hates me, ok...see...I'm...that's then what you get? ....are you still walkin' in that car...?
Hello?
I think you have the wrong number.
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
This isn't meant --
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
And what did your parents do?
Why does that sound silly?
And your father?
Kind of.
How long...you think?
You're here.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
You on any medication?
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
You look great.
Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think --
Are you ok?
I'm sorry.
I can't fuckin' do this.
I'm gonna need a full name, Stanley.
How you doing?
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
Was there anyone that I know?
hey.
It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
But you can't say....
Yes you do.
Can I come in?
Was it a call back?
We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
Do you have an agent, Stanley?
Are you on drugs right now?
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
Linda --
You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  That man, his son does not exist.  HE IS DEAD.  HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?
You been on Prozac long?  Dexadrine?
Pink Dot.
Bottled Water?
Yeah.
Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?
I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.
Let's go,let's go, let's go, you shoulda done that ten minutes ago --
I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
You ready to keep winning?
Go to it, handsome.
Are we gonna keep going with this game?
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
Hi.
..sorry...
....you have it...easy....you know? You have a father who loves you, huh?
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
What -- ?
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
Louis, please -- !
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
How can I serve you in this?
If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
It can.  I know the way.
What is that?
Who is he, Aramis?
You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
Poor Phillippe!
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
A simple theological discussion.
I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life.
Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.
D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
Forgiveness.
And why are you so glum?
The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.
You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest.
We go someplace dangerous.
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
D'Artagnan, unready?
I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
Michelle cannot possibly accept!
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
Where are you going?
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
He lies.  He is here to trap us.
Recent hours have been a shock.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
Continue.
I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?
Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?
Exactly why it should be given away.
... Nothing.
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
What do you think?
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
What did the six-toes have to say?
Find out for me.
Let's roll -
What?
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
Alright, where is she?
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
Yeah?
Where is he?!!
Captain?
What exactly did you see?
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code.
That was her - the girl... We have to go.
I'm stranded out here.
No.  It wasn't like that!
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
Why not?
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it.
Something Lecktor said.
When do you need it?
I'll take you.
That was nice of you to think of that.
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
Do you see?
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Do you see?
'No' what?
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
You will tell the truth?
I want to see Lecktor now.
Can you read it to me?
She'll be in, in the morning...
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
He's right-handed.
He's misunderstood.
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people, didn't he?
To do what?
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you.
Let's forget who said what to whom...
Yes. Is Molly there?
Meet point's up ahead!
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
She got all right?
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
Yes, I thought so.
Do you dream much, Will?
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
No.
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.
No.
You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
What do you want?  "Take my wife, please"??
B-but I have them.
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
Hi...
Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
And all this will be for real?
You're NOT DYING!
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
I'm gonna quit.
So?  What do they know?
Give me the book.
Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
Excuse me, Andy...
Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  The audiences don't work well for him.
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
Is he in his room?
A -- a tourist.
He'll be contacting us again.
We'll need a search running.
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
He's gonna make it.
You're two hours late.
I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
Do you always look at it encoded?
Five.  Since I've been here.
Thanks... for the drink.
Yes.
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
Give me your phone.
What is he doing?
You can't use that until Neo is out!
Morpheus...
This line is tapped so I must be brief.
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
The beginning?
Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
I'm going to make the call.
Hello?
You're the Oracle?
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
My name is Trinity.
What?
How did you do that?
Who is?
What the hell is this?!
What did you just say?
Go!
What happened?
You can't!
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
What?
What?
What are you doing?
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
What are they doing to him?
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
Which way?  Which way?
Operator.
Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
Tank, you're hurt.
They've burned through the outer shields.
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
No.
Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...
Keep quiet about this.  I don't have any license for him yet.  I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me.  I'm the only one he trusts.  Watch.
May God be with you.
You flew before?
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
Panther...
You got some mouth!
Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
Don't promise...just deliver.
Hey...you got nothing here.
Let's get out of here.
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
I think we should see your uncle.
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
How much?
Well, he isn't.  Nice...real nice.
Charlie, this is business.
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
Hey, where you been?
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
No, she's got epilepsy.
"Francis Macomber."
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
Please take it.
Maybe, who knows.
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
It's still sick.
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
You know why...with my parents.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
I'm sleepy.
Come on.
Hey... you got stereo.
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
That's your name?
Look who's talking.
Daddy!
What, honey?
I know you do, darling.
-- Black.
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.
Paillarde of veal.
And that?
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
Well... goodnight.
Thank you for coming.
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?
Perhaps you could remind me.
No, I don't --
I'm not stepping anywhere --
'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
I was saying to Quince we won't need --
Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time.
I'm all excited --
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
Yeah, something he goes by --
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
Shall we adjourn?
Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.
Mind if I throw up?
What are their feelings?
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
That's it?
I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
Doctor lady make it irey.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
She knows how she feel.
Jennifer.
The Board is waiting.
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
That's very gracious of you, Quince.
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
You think so?  How do you know?
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
'Big'?
Susan?
Oh goodness, no.
Very well, I'll watch.
Whatever you do.
Joe, I'm with Drew.
I wanted to apologize, Susan --
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
Yes...
I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
Has her pain abated?
'To bed'?
I love your smell.
You're here?
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
Well -- I --
We know so little about each other --
'Love will find out the way'?
Did I say that?
The 'coffee shop' --
Susan --
You think so?
How long have I got?
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Bill --
How about giving a guy a break?
What's it like where I'm going?
Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
Are you going to eat your lunch
I'm sorry, Bill --
What's okay?
I'm not hungry.
You are?
What the hell do you care?
So that's what love is?
I don't like what you're saying.
I told you to shut up.
Yes.
That's me.
I do?  How long will you be staying?
Where are you?  Are you there?
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
We're all here, Bill --
Good morning, Dad.
I thought you were in a meeting--?
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
You're terrible.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
You know each other?
That was wonderful.
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Nothing.
This is crazy --
Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
I love you, Daddy --
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
What was that?
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
Not at all.
Why?
38.
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 85.
69.
Slam it?
Hiya.
Burt.
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
Amnesia?
Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *
So you're holding my calls?
This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
I like your car.
Jimmy?
You know him?
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
Your wife?
It's not easy to be calm when -
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
Neither do I.
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
Don't talk about my wife.
They're not looking for him.
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
I'm not appealing the decision.
Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
You've read it a hundred times.
Shut your mouth!
Guess I've told you about my condition.
It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.
You really want to find this guy?
You don't know him?
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
Natalie? Natalie who?
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
Unfinished business.
What do you mean "bad news"?
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
What sort of questions?
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
No, you won't.
Why would I do that?						    *
I should kill you.							 *
Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *
Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
And...?
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.
Yeah?
What do you think?
You need to consider a few issues.
My end?
The Keys?
I insist.
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
Like...?
Is it December?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.
Hola, chica.
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
...in the morning.
Jos...
Client got delivery.  But there were..."extras" in the back of the truck.
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
What friend?
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
What do we got?
Like...?
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
Where the hell are you, man?
I am asking.  You to me.
Eleven to seven he blows it.
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
That's right.
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
How?
This I gotta see...  ...the "make up an excuse and stop" part.
You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
C'mon, man!
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
Okay...see you soon.
Okay.
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
And as an investment in the future...
And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
What do you care?
I gotta, I gotta go...!
Yeah?
Must be some mess back there.
I can tell, can't you?
He's got taxi fare.
You think I'm lying!
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
Oh hell, forget it.
You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it.
Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!
You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea?
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?
Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
You got a comb?
They wrong?
But thanks.  Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this or anything. You promise?
What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!
I read it.
Keep the goddam blanket on.
Hell, don't cry about it!
I'm falling apart, that's funny?
What d'you want?
You want me to leave?
I simply don't have it, Joe.
Ready for hard work, son?
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
You really want to do business?
He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is he all right?
The kids? Why are they...
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
Right!  That's what we're shooting for.  Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here.
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
Those mountains? are they?
What's your father do?
Girlfriend?
She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to.
What they give you?
Hello, Billy.
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
You got your stuff?
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
What is it with you man, what the hell is it?
Know what?
Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay!
Jeremy...
Peter...
The Department of Public Health...
For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?
I only got...
What do you-?
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
The lights come up, you pull the switch.
What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.
What are you putting that crap on me for?
But the power...
Just inner chambers...
Do you think we did the right thing?
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
It's me. Can you hear me?
Don't.
Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
What's this?
I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
This wing configuration. I've never...
Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and...
Well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
I'm not much of a critic.
Sure.
Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.
If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
What's it about?
Pretty rough so far.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
Set what up?
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
What about a bee...?
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
Paul, I know you've been out.
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.
Stop--stop right here.
You really think Sheldon's out there?
Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye.
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
People sure like those Misery books.
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
Answer me a couple things?
Newspapers?
Marcia, please.
- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
Your room.
You won.
You picked another winner!
If it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money.
What are you talking about?
Where?
Nyah!
What was the top bid?
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..
Before we kill her or cure her..
That's it?  That's it? That's it?
I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.
How're we doin', then?
Do you know me?
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
Hola..
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
They've got a book for this?
There's nearly 2 million in London.
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
Before you are.
We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..
Have you met them?
-- his left jacket pocket.
I want you out of Australia!  ..I don't know how much more plainly I can put it.
No.
Excuse me?
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
..not in time to save him.
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
Let's start from the inside out.
Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
Come on!
Whats Hunt doing on the TGV?
But why tell us?
Did we get it?
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
What?
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
May I come in?
What happened?
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Two cars.  Where are you?
Ethans right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
Whos dead?
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
Yes.  I see your point.
For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations.  We have a penetration.  The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
What are we downloading?
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
You're not going to any meeting without me.
That's not it.  That's not the list.
Jack.  Jack.
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
I'm willing to take the chance.
Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
I thought I'd take some now.
Oh?  What's the problem?
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
I knew about Jim.
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Yes...  Its him.
Whats the problem.
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
No, I want to see the dessert cart.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
Hi.  Hi.
Johnny Cammareri.
In a month.
Yeah.
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
You haven't once said you like my dress.
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
Why?
Loretta. What's that smell?
I like it well done.
Fast.
When you get engaged?
I don't know.
How many men since then?
Yes.
Loretta.
What? What have we done?
What did I do?
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!
But that's cause he don't know!
You look beautiful. Your hair...
Who painted that?
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
No thanks.
You're making me feel guilty again.
I'm freezing to death.
Ronny!
He's coming.
Loretta?
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
What time is it?
Then let's set the date.
Why not?
So we'll sell the house.
Hi.
I don't wanna talk about it.
He's with his dying mother!
WHAT!! She was dying!
Hi.
What about the moon?
No.
We just come from the bank.
Alright.
Lucy. There are big things going on in my house. My granddaughter Loretta, the only daughter of my son Cosmo, has engaged herself to be married a second time.
Moving in?
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
I'm sure she did.
Thanks, comrade.
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
Temperature's dropping.
Yes.
Rita. Rita.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fianc's in Palermo.
There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
I see.  Yes, of course.
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
Of course.
Yes ...
What is that?
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
What word?
What, "is"?
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
Look!
Hello.
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
Ni, ni, ni!
Ni!
There!  Look!
What?
We shall attack at once.
What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Too late.
Je...sus Christ!
Old woman!
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
Well?
Nothing... There's your ninepence.
He will be soon. He's very ill.
Don't be such a baby.
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
Well taken, Concorde!
At last!   A call!  A cry of distress ...  Concorde!  Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!
Really, I feel fine, sir.
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
Father, lad.
I don't want land.
But I don't like her.
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
If we ... er ... 
Right.
Yes ...  make sure ...
Well ...
Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
Well ... yes ...
I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.
When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle.
Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
Not bad, not bad.
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
She's got an army of people to get her up and out.
She'll get over it.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
The place is a mess.
It's what the maids are for.
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
It's the Queen's decision.
I wish to see my mother.
Convey her a message.
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised!
No.
Go inside at once.
The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.
Do you hunt?
Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views.
You're injured.
You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
So...?
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
No loyalty.
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
Mr Brown.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
What are those?
Those, over there, there.
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
John?
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime?
This is my good John Brown.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.
A fine choice, sir.
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
Unwell?
How long has he been this sick?
Who told them that?
I have a letter, ma'am.
That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.  But you are not eating enough.  One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.
Why is he not here?
How the hell did you do that?
Could you play ARCADE with that?
Dead?
Maybe he's not dead.
Now what seems to be the problem?
Talk to me.
He thinks I'm "sublimating".
Sick?
What do you mean by "weird"?
Happy?
No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here".
So how did it know my name, then?
That's what I thought.
I've been thinking about that.  ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin?
I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...
You feel it?  It's different this time.
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.
And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake.
So that's what we almost died for?
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
Then we'll go home?
Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!
But I don't understand...
It means she's screwed up.
They fired everyone.
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
And?
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
Howdy!
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
So, what did they say?
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
I...
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
That's okay.
My name is Rita.
No, no, I'm fine.
Number 17.
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
I think I've been hurt.
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
"You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
To my audition.
No, we don't.
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
I had a dream about this place.
Yeah, they showed me
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Hardly.
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
So what do we do ?
First Bank ? But how ?
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.
It won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.
Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
I... I .....
I wanted to let his family know....
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
You okay ?
If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.
Are you Matthew Parker ?
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ? 
What's next Walt ?
It's fine thanks.
Issues ??? This guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue I've ever heard of.
Hey, try swimming. It works.
You okay ?
Johnny, let's get the cleanup started.
Trust is earned not given away.
You did.
What's wrong ?
Any priors ? Any police record ?
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
No. I was just curious if what I heard about you is true ?
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
No. I am not a homosexual.
I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
Thank you very much.
What the ... ?
The power went out in half the park.
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
Hey... did we uhm, you know....
The roof is coming down.... hey, you.... Which door gets us out of here ??
How's your foot ?
Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !
Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.
He was right behind me !
Good morning.
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
People said she looked like me.
Excuse me I asked you a question.
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
Wow, you walked out with my mother?
Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
What does that mean?
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
I will. How's Shelly?
What happened to Shelly?
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
It's okay really, I was just a baby.
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.
And she saved it.
Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
Hi.
Hi.
Vada, he was giving you an easy out so you wouldn't have to write about your mother.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
Hello.
What can I do for you?
This is really very nice of you.
He's writing. Hello?
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
He said it was a gift.
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
Getting off please.
Care for a smoke?
Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
Just come and get it...right here!
...I dropped it.
Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.
I should do this myself.
Then you'll be all set.
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
Bye Aunt Rose.
Something wrong?
Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
What's this? December 8th, 1958?
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
It would be fantastic.
Beidermeyer?
He's a great poet.
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Wanna play?
Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
Hey, you didn't pay me!
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
You are perfectly healthy.
Stiffs??
I need the job.
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
Well the other night at dinner...
Hi.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
Does it make it easier to win?
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
Home sweet home.
Yeah.
No, why?
I haven't danced in.....
Rock?
What are you wearing?
Do you want to?
I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Well, you were pretty great!
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
Did you ahh, love him?
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
VADA!
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
Goodnight Vada.
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
Are they ready yet?
Hi Vada.
What are you doing.
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
I found this.
What was my mama like?
Really?
Oh yes, oh that's great.
Hi.
I paid the money.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
My Dad was funny?
Who's winning?
He's allergic to everything.
Hi.
Did you read ALL these books?
Are you married?
Sure.
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.
I'm hemorrhaging.
I think it should be outlawed.
Goodnight.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
Oh great!
Hey look at this, no feet!
No, I'm going home.
It doesn't work, it always stays black. 
What's wrong with your eyes?
You have no personality.
Who's that with your Dad?
THIS!! 
Woah!!
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
Got it!
Jump in the water!!
Come on, let's go.
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
I dunno..
Well when you get older, you just have to.
Just do it.
... trouser width, this is all classic.  Which means safe, something I'd wear.
Stay, huh?
Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
You have no appropriate sense of emergency.  My best friend is ruining his life.
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
I suppose it's too late to start over.
You're going to say it, aren't you?
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Needing.
I did what I came to do.
Excuse me?
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
But he sure can kiss.
I mean, he loves his job.
For the twins? What in the world is th...

Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
I've been calling for days!
And she's all wrong for me!
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
Where was that, Florence, huh?
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
Should I whistle down a cab?
No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.
Big weddings are so strange.
Don't you throw up on boat?
And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
... your one chance for true happiness?
The Big Hurt, huh?
What's up?
Jules, what's wrong...
Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
Almost three.
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
Winifred.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
Then why are you listening to her -
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
What do you really want?
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
He's going to run for president.
Well, how about the shopping center?
You want anything?  A drink?
Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
Yes, but we're just singing.
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
You bet.
Yes, sir. I need a room
I didn't think it would. She's calling herself L.A. Joan this- week. Last week it was Dakota. Guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything.
You know anything about the stations here?
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
Have you seen a woman about so high?
Wrecks.
Nashville.
I feel really good.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
How long have you been with them?
Hello.
I'm not sure. Where?
I'd really like to see you.
Well...How have you been?
Oh?
I'm twenty-eight
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
You know who that is?
They said go see the chaplain.
I can do benefits
Where's Bill?
Where are you going?
Probably a little too long.
Come on.
I'm Opal.
He is to a lot of people.
Ah... Peter Finch.
Peter Finch -- he's English.
You want a ride into town?
It's not bad.
What was the color of Tim's belt?
Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
By all means, knock yourself out.
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
Who is we?
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.
Who isn't?
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?
Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
How come you never talk?
Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.
Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---
What I'd like to do---
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The cops, my mom, everybody. But you see, they all missed the point of the story. I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding the shotgun, it all became clear. I realized for the first time my one true calling in life. I'm a natural born killer.
Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off.
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
Yeah baby.
How can you say that you 'admire' them?
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway.
Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.
And where do you keep Mickey?
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.  You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in.
Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing.
Rollin'...and speed!
But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
Ya know, I was.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
'You Duff Anderson?
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
Yeah.
What d'you want?
She done moved to Detroit.
They say your dad's 'round town.
Any other family?
Like hell. You know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it.
How 'you doin' man?
My father's the preacher.
That's right.
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
How d'you mean?
But I would like to see you again.
I wouldn't have let you.
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
Don't push me, Duff.
I can see why.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
You know how to box?
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
Hi.
You know - we do have enough money. Especially now.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
Day work.
Don't do that!
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
Okay.
That's right.
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
'See ya.
'You Will Anderson?
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
Want me to hold the light for you?
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
What did you say, boy?!
How often is that?
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.
Man, you won't like that back seat.
I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
He's your son.
Better now.  Where 'you at?
I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.
Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.
Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
Ghost a steppin' razor...
Easy...
Alright. Let's talk business.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
Tell me the words.
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
Yo.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
I know who you are.
I had to limit your options.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
How long have I been out?
I gotta know... did it work>
How soon is soon enough?
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
Case... Are you alright?
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
I know.
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
Like what?
What the fuck kind of questions are those?
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
What is with this school and prom?
It is?
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
Oh, man! Who told?
YOU DID.
Gus, have you ever been in love?
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
Well excuse me.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Senorita Josie.
Now this is cute.
You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
It's an expose on cafeteria food.
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!
Hey Rob, what's going on?
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
Whoa. Deja Vu.
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
Yoooooow.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
Yes.
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
Aloha! Welcome!
By name.
He sure is big, Jack...
Yes.
Yes.
You're mine, you know.  I made you.
That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
Coming...
Taste it.
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
Where are you going?
Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories.
Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas.
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
Wanna join your little friend?
So, what about you and that Poletti girl?
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
Who told you to choke up that way?
You okay?
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
Are you okay.
What's all this.
What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
About not finding any bogey men?
What is it?
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...
Who, Jesse?
Hi.
Hi, guys.
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
Yor dad picking the music again?
Did she always have nightmares?
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
Girl, what are you doing?
I know who's trying to kill you.
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he?
You like gymnastics?
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.
What's that?
Kristen, can you pull us out?
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
Max, where's Kristen?
You got five minutes.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a little trouble understanding that, Princess.
But nightmares are the common thread?
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
You're late.
Must have opened while I was away at school.
Take us there, Kristen.
We can try again.
You're not going in.  That's exactly what he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.
I've heard crazier things this week.
Who would know where they were hidden?
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
Okay, straight talk only in here.
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
Somebody else is out here.
Science...I suppose.
This wing's been closed for years.  What was this place?
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
I'm in.
Wait a minute.  What about me?
That was such a great evening.
No!
God, that's an enormous arse.
Sorry about that...
Coffee?
Thank you.
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
Okay -- fine.
If that's all right.
Okay.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
Busy tomorrow?
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
Why?
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
Hi.  Can I come in?
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
I have thought about you.
Yup.
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Wow.
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
Can I stay a bit longer?
How are you doing?
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
This is certainly... ah...
But... wait... there are things to say.
Well... how have you been?
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
Thank you, Bernie.  Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
He's bringing a girl?
Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?
Bella -- this is Anna.
Do you want to stay?
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
That's nice.
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
Bernie -- this is Anna.
Is this your first film?
What do you think?  Good move?
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
'Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me.
Are you a fan of Henry James?
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
Right -- want another one?
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
You haven't slept with her, have you?
Do you ever masturbate?
Well?
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
Oh God no.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Does she know you're coming?
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
Cool, huh?
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
Right.  No one else?
What did she say?
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
I wouldn't go outside.
No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
The one down your trousers.
Yes, Mister Harding?
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
Yes, Mister McMurphy.
Yeah?
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
That's it! We made it!
Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
I hope everything is settled.
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
Yeah, kid?
Marry who?
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
What for?
Where's Martini and Scanlon?
It's the questions she asks.
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
I'll bet a dollar.
Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
Let me see your hand!
Gimme a cigarette!
Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.
Yeah, buddy?
Hit me!
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!
My turn.
Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Poker!
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
What's troubling ya, buddy?
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!
Yeah!
Out. It's the way out. So just keep it in your minds if ya ever wanna make use of it.
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
What are they?
Who is he?
Hit me!
Yes, I see it! I see it!
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
At this hour?
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.
Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly.
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
He is your husband, no?
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
No.
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?
That's not the point.
Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
Uh, I'd rather not say.
Mickey Spillane.
And she's a knock-out, too.
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
You okay?
I'm sorry.
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
There's no such thing.
Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
I was hoping for the real thing.
Been here long?
What looks good?
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
I don't have an Amana freezer.
Is everything okay?
I wish you didn't have to go so early.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
What's he do?
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
Come on, it's not so bad.
But one day you wake up and realize you've been had.  Of course life isn't like the movies.  That's why there are movies.
Have you seen him with someone?
I have vacation time coming to me.
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
You okay?
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
"Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
What are you doing?
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
You expecting somebody you know?
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
I think it's time we got some professional help.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
Who said I was going?
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
So...
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
A porco?
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
I came after the woman I love.
Yeah--
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.
Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.
But my own kid bro
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against 
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped
ex-tanker who's walking on his heels ?
What the hell!!!
It was you, Charley... .
Father Barry.
Terry...?
They're waiting for him to walk in.
Everybody loved Joey. From the little kids to the old rummies.  Did you know him very well?
In braids? That's right.
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
How do you like that one?
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now but I think we're getting in love with each other.
Pigeons... .
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
Edie...
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
Edie.
Then go ahead go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.
You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
I don't get it!
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
You can!
Who asked him here?
Now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one?  Are you? Are you? How about you, Nolan?
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
I guess it's pretty tough work at that.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
Where you going? I'll walk along with you.
I wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, Terry?
Better.
What's wrong with your shoulder?
You ought to go home and take care of that
Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.
Count this.
I I was just on my way up, Johnny.
It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
All of my books are based on fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
Something's making that music.
What do you mean?
Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
You're talking nonsense.
I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
I would have time for my own pleasures!
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
Your pleasures of course!
You better hope there is.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
He wants us.
I could make her another Cleopatra...
Yes.
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.
Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.  They musta robbed fifty banks together.
I'm not dressed.
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
I don't know where he is.
It's Richard Ripley.
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
Nice disguise.
Let's go to Detroit.
First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of.
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
You know they gonna set us up.
They found the safe.
We made it, didn't we?
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
That's all I wanted to know.
You get the key?
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
Leave it where it is.
What do you want to bet?
You excited?
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Hello?
Karen, I told you not to--
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
You comfy?
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
Is that right?
That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>.
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
Don't leave me.
You like bourbon?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
Well, does it make sense to you?
You like taking risks.
Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
I wasn't sure you caught that.
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
So.  What's your point?
You think he's lying?
What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
Whose blood you got all over you?
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
Really?
I know what you're talking about.
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
You goin' right back to work?
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?
Have they got Midge up there?
What's it mean, "No Hair"?
There were others.
You don't remember me, do you?
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Gee, I wonder why not.
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
Hi, Ray.
How's it going?
What's wrong with you?
Here?  In this house?
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
"Hey, yourself."
He doesn't even look like that.
Was it Foley?
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
Did you pay the guy the reward?
What?
...the fuck is this...
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
What lizard?
Rafe's girl, Evelyn?
Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...
They ready, Earl?
Then why are you looking for her?
You hear my okay?
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
And where's the secret base, Sir?  The one we t-takeoff from.
Is that the good new, Sir, or --
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
Win?
What's your name?
What do you get for winning?
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave, Admiral.
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
Fook ya!
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
You see us as capable of such a blow?
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
Welcome to the singles scene.
We're going to take you home.
I'll call you Later.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
Peggy Sue!
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
You got a Tab?
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
A lot's happened since last weekend.
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
What are you doing here?
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love  Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
What're you doing here?
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
Don't get your hopes up.
This is great reefer.
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
Ssh. He's great.
I thought I knew everything about him.
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
Hi, Dad.
The hat business is in trouble.
Yes.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightheaded.
Mom!
I have a note.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
What happened to you?
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
What's up?
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a foureyed worm.
Dancing with you.
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
I came to say goodbye.
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
I hear you moved into town.
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
What?
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
Just out.
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
What are you talking about?
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
Is this a good spot?
This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.
Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...
I've never had anyone die before...  ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...
How can he not have a heartbeat?
You ever think about running away?
I know, Mom.
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
Allright. Calm down.
What was the file name?
This time. What about next time?
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
Drew!
Jerk... What did you say?
Fuck you.
What's wrong with you?
I'm not ready to die.
Thanks for coming in.
We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...
New baby?
Kids are great.
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
I'm a law suit.
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
Beckett?
What?
Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...
I know a good probate lawyer.
Opera?
I'll look over the Q and A.
You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct?
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
Yes.
Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
In what way?
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
Great.
You're the asshole, buddy.
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
You taught him a lesson.
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?
Gonna lose everybody out here....
You came for us....
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
But I just wanted to say --
Riddick? What the hell are you --
What about her?
Back to the ship, huh?
How many you see?
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
What, you're afraid?
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
Just come with me!
Step aboard, Carolyn.
Just give me your hand.
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
And him?
We just keep him locked up forever?
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
So why isn't it all bloody?
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
How much you weigh, Johns?
This does not help us, Johns.
Just shut up, okay?
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
Frightening thought.
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
We crossed our own tracks.
A toast to whatever he just said.
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
Well, what's it look like now?
Such as.
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
Aw, this can't be happening to me....
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
An' this?
Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
Take it.
Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
I apologize.
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
Seal the cave?
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
The best. But we won't need them.
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
Look -- she remembers.
Now, just a minute --
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
Well, maybe they're not.
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
How did it go?
Got your sensors?
No.
Taylor -- quit riding him.
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
Objection!
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
I want her.
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
Who put them up?
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
This is a joke in very poor taste.
What about me?
No.
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
What is this?
Listen-
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
You want her that much?
Taylor! Tell him.
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
Would you like to come along?
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
Do you believe him?
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
...but 'Lias is still out there.
We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here. 
Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.
Hey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass today. I killed a shit-eating dog. 
Don babytalk him man. Cocksucker fell asleep. They walked right up on us, he don do shit.
Where's he from?
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Taylor! Francis!
Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got...
Come on man!
...I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time.
Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...
I'll go with you.
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
Must be somebody?
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
Right on.
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
You wanted to see me sir?
Right...
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
I think you're drunk.
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
Your liquor laws..
It might be worth a Martini to you.
They'll know whether he killed himself.
What time is it?
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
Cold?
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
Then he's got to be a detective.
Us?
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
Me?
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
I'll have to know a little more than that.
That's an evasion and you know it.
Well, that's not getting us anywhere. You won't tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. You won't even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy marriage?
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
We try to be decent.
You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
I'd like a few words with you, in private.
Thank you.
In case you want to have us followed.
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
I have a warrant for her arrest.
Information.
And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
What are you doing here?
What do you want?
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
Recently, then.
I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
You in charge here?
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
"G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
You can find out.
No suicide.
Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco.  Just like you thought...Two murders in two days.  Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
Scotch and plain water, I think.
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
I don't understand.
So far.
Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior.  Young Mitchell's father. He just flew in from Toronto.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield?
What'll we do about it, Margo?
What's this?
Of course.
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
Terrific.
Attributed?
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
So it's all worked out perfectly...
Oh yes?
Damn.  They're early.
I called you a taxi.
Did she talk about me?
I haven't seen much of you.
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
We don't seem to get much time to talk.
Blas and epicene.
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal...
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
Hold those rights.
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
Perhaps I will, then.
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
Hello.
Okay, I will.
Oh, I see.
I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.
What have you got there?
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
Don't you gamble?
I gotta be fucking crazy.
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
One shot stopping.
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
You're a fucking dead man--
I can't do this.
Wild ride, huh?
Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in.
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
They don't go for the vault?
Yeah.  What's your theory?
... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
Johnny, it's the only way.
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
... so I started tailing him.
I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.
What do you want?
This gonna take long?
Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
Nice place.
What's goin' on?
You had enough?
Look at you.
Ouch.
Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?
Bye.
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
Mean anything to you?
Thanks.
What's got Billy so spooked?
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...
I like your hat.
It's... it's not like that.
You don't know anything about me.
Mr. Harris.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
New York.
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
Get in.  This side.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Room service.  What do you drink?
Let's talk some more first.
Uh-huh.
Try a strawberry.
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
Did you sleep well?
Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
Hello?
You're upset, huh?
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
Okay.
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
I've never been on a plane before.
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
I know.  I'm glad.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
Aw, don't... no...
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
Cynthia's not coming?
Love this car!  Is it new?
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
What!?
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
You're being ridiculous.
This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
Did I wake you?
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
Kit...
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
Yeah, what?
<u>Housekeeping</u>.  I come to turn down the bed.
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
I got a dress.
What is it, Miss Vivian?
In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
Miss Vivian --
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
Having a good time, Vivian?
You don't believe me?
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
I fear I'll never see you again.
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
Why is that, do you think?
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
I brought you a special present.
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
Yellin.
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
Now?
Where's Fezzik?
No.
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
There's something I ought to tell you.
I must know.
Kill me quickly.
Go in, get after her!
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
Yes.
Inhale this, but do not touch.
What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
You guessed wrong.
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
Yeah, an hour.
You feeling any better?
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
"Of the silvery mooooon,
Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
Yes sir.
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
But that's cheating!
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
What did I do?
Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
What???
Will you get a hold on yourself.
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
Where would you like to eat?
It won't run a week!
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
What is she gonna do here?
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
Maybe it's not true!
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
I never should have listened to you.
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Min Bialystock.
You, Blum go Motel.
Feeling better?
So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
Of Siegfried...
The Graf Spee...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
We are falling back on all fronts. Our soldiers are retreating.
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
No. At least I don't recall.
No.
What do you mean?
Not at all!
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
Now, look...!
Let's all talk about Mary.
You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
Were there any calls?
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
She stole some money.
You should've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped. You go starting private investigations, using people you don't even know...
I'm Mary's sister.
Where?
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
I ought to call the police right now!
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
You want me to stay here?
Where... can I stay?
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
He didn't come back here?
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
In a hurry.
Our Deputy sleeps.
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
Huh?
You going to wait here for me?
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
What?
The only girlish thing you have lost.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
You can't laugh at it, huh?
And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
How can you even think a thing like that!
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
I imagine so.
You go out... with friends?
Only my share.
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
She sounded strong...
You're not going to... to your room already?
That's it. 
You slept here all night?
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
May I see your license?
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
Barefaced.
Looking for me?
Satisfied with your cabin?
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
...Forty thousand dollars!
Yes.
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime.
Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
Gosh, you had me fooled.
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U> case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody--you have him haven't you?
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
Take me down there.
You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.
What were you dreaming about?
The child!
There's no child here.
There's no child here, and no dogs either.
You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
But what about lunch?
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
I think so.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
Are you giving me this straight?
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
Meaning what?
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
I am right! I know I'm right!
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is. 
No kiddin'?
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
I don't remember. Not so very far--
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch.
Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before -- 
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
You weren't going with her?
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
What is it? What happened?
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
But I have some friends waiting.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
Have you got it? Is it completed?
She is the soul of that statue.
Yep. Everything settled.
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
What?
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
Of what?
What did it want?
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
Dysfunctional --
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Buddy, you're just a child.
Here comes Daddy.
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
The new girl is here.
Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
What'd you say, Brother?
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
I think she's gonna kiss him.
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
A baby... and she isn't even married.
Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
How goes it, darlin'?
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile. You don't think about what you're doing and you'll run into a telephone pole.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Boys? You say to me boys?
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed.  I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her.
She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson.
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
How is she?
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
Rose, what are you doing up?
Is anything wrong?
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
What have you got in your hair, girl?
Strange voices, Rose?
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job!
Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.
I see. Outside it.
Um-m, well...
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
Mother... is Rose going to die?
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
Yes, Ma'am.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
Never again, never again...
Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
I... I can explain...
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath?
What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.
This is private property.  This is breaking and entering!
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
She's right.  If you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you "daddy."
You shouldn't litter.
This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast!
All I got is being a cop.  What do I do if I'm not that?
Okay, we got... one, two... three...  Two Caddies and Poe's Mustang.
Where we going?
Gimmie a butt.
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
Birth control's important.
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
I can't believe we're stealing.
No, we're stealing.
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
He tried to kill us.
Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
Alright?
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!
You need a doctor.
Let's get this thing done.
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
Alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together?  Find out who "A.D." is.  I got a quick errand to run.
How'd we do?
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
Do tell.
I don't think so.
You see that?
This shit was Ming.
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.
There's still good in him.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Han!
Are you all right?
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
Someone who loves you.
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
Lando, grab it!
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
What are you telling them?
We're coming!
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
All wings report in.
Oh!
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
Tell me.
If that is your destiny.
Well, I'm sorry.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
Janet!
Yes.
Yes Brad.
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
Oh....Say something.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
Hello.
Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
What a guy
What guy
I think you had better both come inside.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
Hey, how's my buddy doin'?  -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later.
It's Thanksgiving.
I just dislocated my finger.
I would say you're very shy by nature.
It's only temporary.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
I always knew you was pretty.
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
What did you say about a pet shop?
Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out.
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
Don't do that again!
I'll carry him 'till the third.
Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!
How 'bout this Billy Snow?
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
This a con?
Seven minutes!
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
I say ya nothin'!
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
Yo' yellow, old man.
Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder. An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay?
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Yo, you gonna show, Tony?
Rocky, would you be interested in --
Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
Listen, I hope ya don't --
Goodnight, Rocky.
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
More like thirty.
Think about it.
Here's the card?
'Bout an hour ago.
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
How 'bout a glass of water?
Really think so?
What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein.
How am I doin'?
Ya nose is broke.
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
Wanna keep goin'?
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.
...What kinda dog is this again?
Ya always in a bad mood --
The girl's dryin' up! She's gotta live a little before her body dries up!! You're a pal, Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to her? Y'know, it's Thanksgivin' tomorrow.
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
I'll do okay.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
How ya feelin'?
Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together?
Ain't sure, what's the story?
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
He's a riot.
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
Hold on a second.
Now what?
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Maybe.  Why?
You tricked me, damn you!
What the hell are you doin'?
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
Say, who's this guy laughin'?
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
No, kid, you're a real hero.
No better?
Have patience!
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Romeo! Romeo!
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
A challenge, on my life.
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
Either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
Is the day so young?
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Every man betake him to his legs.
What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
Banishment? Be merciful, say death; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death. Do not say Banishment.
How well my comfort is revived by this.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
I come for my lady Juliet.
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help?
Faith, here it is. I think it best you marry with this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman. I think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is dead--or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him.
I take thee at thy word.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
And so did I.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
It's under your seat.
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
I don't know.
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
Lose them!
About time!
Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
It's quite satifactory.
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
I'd stake my reputation.
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
Where's the case?
Yes, Gregor, they sent me.
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
We'll double your price.
Do you have the material?
Do you have it?
What do you mean?
We'll die if we stay here!
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
Bullshit!
So what do we do?
A means to an end, is that it?
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
Yeah.
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
So what is it you want to know?
The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
Long enough to shoot back.
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
Perhaps the police?
Cigarette?
I didn't know that you spoke French.
Same thing, isn't it?
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
What's going on?
That there was a gun pointed at me.
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
I borrowed that, too...
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
Clearly.
The Irish representative?
I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
You were behind the door?
They don't have the package.
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
No you don't, and you know it.
Would you stop with that...
And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
That's a good question.
I know.
You slept with her!
You put everything on the line because you...
Can you get it?
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
Oh, you would have done great.
What are we going to do?
Well someone's gonna find them.
It won't work.
That's right!
I've got one condition.
We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
It's the right thing to do.
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
That's not what I mean.
And how do you figure we do that?
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
You said that last time!
You're out of your mind.
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
Oh Jesus...
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
There's going to have to be a change in our arrangement.
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
Sally?  I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave.
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
Let's not get into this again. I know him.  If you said something, he'd take it out on me.
Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...
I don't know, Booth.
Sally, do you love me?
Yeah, I've seen him.
What makes you say that?
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Hello.
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
Yeah, she is.  She comes up to about here on me.
Let's see...do you know her cup size?
C?
Aw, now thats gonna take time to clear!
She's not his type.
Why?
Hey where's the hot pad?
Whatever...
Dwayne please calm down!
I'll settle for a third of that.
We're out of here.
What do you mean?  You gambled it?
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --
Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.
That's great Earl!
Don't you want it?
Well I don't know --
Thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
The band has been playing over an hour.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
Oh, you American?
You get massage from Chinese girl before?
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
All I did was invite them for a drink.
Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
It's my job!
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
How do you know he's our man?
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
Is it hot in here?
No.  It's not right.
What's she doing?
Pick it up!
Wait!  There's people down there!
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
Are you okay?
Well we're not friends.
Fine.
What's a Chinese heaven?
I think we should stop talking.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
Very nice.
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
Let's go.
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
Ricky Tan is alive.
You go after Ricky.  I got this.
I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.
Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.
I could use a little vacation.
Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
All he wanted was some mu-shu.
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
Lee!  It's him!
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
Feds asked for me?
Help me Rhonda.
It's the same thing!
Right....
You make the plate?
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
You know War?
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
Excuse me?
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
Oh my god...what happened to you?
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
Yeah. So why you look do down?
Any demands yet?
How much they want?
I'm talking about the girl.
What kind of assignment is that?
Hmmmm?
What?!
Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
You got a boy friend in here yet? Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
Hello.
He is very good.
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
Really?
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
Of course.
And in a "V".
"Sink the putt."
"Nothing but net."
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
Look, he's running after her.
In vino veritas.
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
Okay, we'll order out.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Thanks.
Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
It's nice that they're still friends.
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
That's fair.
Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
Maybe someday.
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
No.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Kind of isolated.
It's fun!  It's high.
Lost!
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
I'm listening.
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
I'm going to kill myself.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
Lighten up, wahine.
He's going to be the pastor?
Let's go.
What are you talking about?
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
Am I what they had in mind?
Even when you were young?
We'll stay at the Plaza --
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
Beautiful view, isn't it?
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
It's not true, but it feels true.
You're a basket case.
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
Yes.
Men never get this movie.
You don't know who she was, Annie --
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
Honey, he wasn't right for you.
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
Howard.
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.
You know.
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
So you'll get married in a new dress.
Sure you do.
Hi.
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
Where's your mom?
And you're worried about him.
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda ... She's a weightlifter, but it's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --
You'll find out.
You'll see.
Do you want a fruit plate?
Dad --
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
Dad, I don't know about this one --
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
I'm sorry.  I'm just --
How did they get our phone number?
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
Jed's got cables.
It was sinking.
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
This is a good letter, Dad.
It's a sign.
Why is she bringing that bag?
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
Don't ever do that again.
What are you doing up?
There's a bathroom upstairs.
Did you call that radio station again?
Everyone at work heard you.
God, she's beautiful.
I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
Do you like baseball?
What about camping?
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
Is he there?
It takes time --
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
Take a drink. Calm down!
How goes it?
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
Are you sick, Mama?
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
This water's cold again.
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
Was it expensive, the beer?
What's the matter?
A fighter, huh?
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
How do you feel?
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
Tell me.
You mean you're ready to give up?
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
You know I don't think that.
Where's your mama?
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.
No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it.
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
What is it?
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
I ain't a idiot, asshole.
How?
Go ahead.
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
It gets me through the day.
Who is it?
He knows where I work.
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
Really, I don't want to.
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
My features. They're Finnish.
I'm hurting.
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
Why does it have to feel so bad?
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
Why?
But...I've seen you.
Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
Nah... I want to keep it.  Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
Shoot him.
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
I've got a hot one.
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
No last name?
You think I'm a Judas?
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
Bullshit. He's a liar.
Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can we talk about this?
Please ... don't do this ...
Jimmy?
What's on the other end of this thing?
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
When is the deal going down?
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
Tom, quit fucking around.
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
Where's Bubba?
Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday.
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
A private, sir?
Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.
That must be four thousand yards.
Jackson?
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
So, that's Ryan.
Y'all come back.
He ain't half-bad, I guess.
He ain't Wade.
No kiddin'?
It's worth it.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.
Glad of it.
But you could have gotten killed and I...
It looks like a Renoir.
I've been humming it.
Good luck, Captain.
That only leaves three.
I wonder where they're going.
What'd you say, Captain?
Captain, what about our deal?
What about the company?
Fresh out.
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.
How about...?
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
Uh, oh.
I don't think so, Captain.
Trust me, you're the best.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
No, sir.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body.
This evening is over.
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
Hi.
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
That's not even a scam.
Yes.
Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.
So, what's your point?
I don't feel anything.
I wouldn't get my hopes up Lloyd.
I can't give you that.  This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years.  He's been getting it from every end.  I'd love to hear his story.
Ha!
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
I'm sorry.
I won?
Morning honey.
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
Lloyd?
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.
I swear to god.
Honey, about what?
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
Hello.
Thank-you.  The real world.
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?
Are you busy on Saturday?
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Whoa.
What are these?
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
Nobody knew me before tonight.
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
It's just you and your dad, right?
Won't you see me later?
Stop by later.
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
No.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Yeah.  With potential.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
Are you comfortable?
I don't think I am.
Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
It did?
I think that we should spend some time apart.
Well, I need to study, and...
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
You shared it with a dick.
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
Good to know.
No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
You're freaking out here man.
YEAH!
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
How ya doing?  Is she around?
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
I know
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
I love you man
Now you're back.
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.
You took my workers.
You're not telling me something.
This is not my problem.
What are you doing?
One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
That'd be fine.
You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?
I'll talk to him.
I'll talk to you later.
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
He's stealing from you, Oskar.
We know that, son.
How's the name search going?
I would say we are now officially baffled.
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
Fair enough.
Where is Sidney's father?
Jesus, youre just as whacked as your son.
What are you going to do?
I could use some therapy.
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
Yeah, were trying to send a message to Hollywood. Im really getting tired of all the happy endings. Its just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
Need some help, honey.
Youre the one who got away.
Of course not. Who wants to? Whats the point if we dont get caught? Wheres the glamour in that?
So we found a compromise.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
Not good. How you doin?
You broke my heart.
And it's sexier in the dark.
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Let's go.
Dewey?
Oh my God. How could it happen?
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
You're getting obvious.
No, wait...
Sid, I'll come with you.
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.
Knock yourself out.
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
And white.
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
She's not here right now.
Do you want to die?
I hate scary movies.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..
You ass.
I'll be right back.
What do you want?
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
Jesus.  Hello?
Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
Please, call me Gale.
Four? There are five.
You seem to like movies, Detective.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
Hmm.
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
I can see nothing's changed.
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
Jennifer needs me.
What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Geez.
No really?
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
Are you saying she was-
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.
You're not happy with your part.
Who's this?
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
But you know my favorite name?
It's Sarah.
No.
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
WHERE?
Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
No I need to call you. Just you.
Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
You rode your bike out there?
What are you doing here?
Close call.
Oh Billy... Please... God...
You know that's not true.
No...
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
I think you have the wrong number.
Just some scary movie.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
Where are you?
What kind of game?
I don't know...
But you're doing so well.
What door am I at?
I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
He's not a suspect, is he?
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
I'll call for backup.
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
Off the record. No cameras.
Many times.
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
Can you see me right now?
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
Don't come any closer.
If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?
Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
Which is you...
I thought everything was checked out.
We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
There goes my chance with Sid.
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back."
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.
Do you believe this shit?
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
Or a man's mentality.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Do you really think Billy did it?
Take a message.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
Where we headed?
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.
A woman...
I need to start getting the feel of it all, right?  Meet the people.
You just met me.
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
You've seen my files, right?  Seen the things I've done?
How's that?
All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
He must have left another puzzle piece.
No fingerprints?
You're sure your men didn't move this?
He just may be nuts enough.
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you?  About catching this guy.  You really want to believe that, don't you?
I wish I still thought like you.
Why would we?
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.
This is a waste of time.
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
Are you alright?
He's preaching.
The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  Murders in the Rue Morgue.  Le Fanu's Green Tea.  My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
You knew I'd say yes.
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
No.
Stay with him.
I need you to look at each one carefully... very carefully.  Look for anything that seems strange or out of place.  Anything at all.
Anything... anything missing or different.
It smells good.
How long have you lived here?
Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours.  It was nothing new.  But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.
Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
How's California?
Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...
Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...

Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
Scar! Where's he holed in?
Hey! What's the idea...?
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
What's that got to do with us?
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
Comancheros...
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...

Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
Why else?
Stop that!
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
I'll do it myself.
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
Where have you been all day?
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
Who's that?
What?
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
Martin, what-
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
How did you get me out of there?
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
What?
Hammer?
Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?
Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.
WillWhere is Mercutio?
You did not like the speech?
Oh
Follow that boat!
Thank you, my lady!
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
Most interesting.
So now you are free to love
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
There's never any
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
Is it going well?
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
It is over.
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
Who is she this time?!
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Where are you going?
Now where? Will?
Cut round him for now.
Romeo.
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
We are lost.
Kit
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
The daughter of his enemy.
His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
Good luck with yours, Kit.
This is a different one.
God bless you!
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
Your Majesty.
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
What do you love so much?
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
"I know not."
"All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
Master Shakespeare
"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
I have, Master Shakespeare.
I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives.
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
And that was only my first try.
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
Oh, Will!
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
Nono.
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
An excellent beginning  Let him bea duke. And your heroine?
But all ends well.
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
She loves me, Thomas!
Your aunt?
And her lips?
What of her bosom?
But what of Lord Wessex?
"Poet?"
Here we come at last, my lord!
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
Is there a man?
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
All right, just a few questions.
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing?
I was trying to educate you.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
No, she's not in. Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work.
Alex, I don't have the time --
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
What? Yes, that's fine.
Not eating what?
I want to secure it.
They know.
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Don't know what?
Sorry to waste your time.
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?
I thought you stopped going.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
So we'll meet him, then?
David hasn't seen him either.
Maybe he didn't like us.
He's got a car?
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
Don't.
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
Look over there. It's Cameron.
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
No.
Will you calm down.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
Leave him alone.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
No, nothing, sorry.
Of course.
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
I see.
Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
Are you all right?
Two hundred.
Two hundred pounds.
I'm sorry.
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
And that's why I think you fit in here.
What guy?
Oh, him. Well, he died.
What's it about?
Writing seems easy.
October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. Seven six five.
Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.
I suppose so.
Offering it for debate.
Your watch.
You're in a good mood today, George.
Chicken salad.
I thought you were in a good mood.
Do you think George is a fairy?
That kid... the hairdresser.
What're you looking for?
She's got a...
She did?
Wow.
Nummers.
George --
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
I can see that.
What about?
Is she all right?
No, I know.
Hi.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
That headboard.
You going to answer it?
Then it's not your problem.
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
Shit.
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
You're my mother's hairdresser?
Well, are you? Are you queer?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
No kidding.
Yeah...
How is she?
You do know what money's like these days.
Yes, Buffums.
What!
So how's Norman?
Well, what do you think?
You don't seem very sure.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
What's wrong?
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
George...
Sit down.
Look, either come in or stay out!
We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
-- yeah.
-- what?
-- very nice, very nice.
-- ass and legs --
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
-- good afternoon --
So I'm saying it...
-- Right after I sprayed her?
Hey, what's happening?  Mary! Telephone.  What's the matter?
Yeah?...
Yeah!
-- took a bus.
Jackie Shawn.
Here in the canyon.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
How are you, baby?
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
You're great.
But in the same house, you know, one house.
Maybe you don't even like children.
George?
George.
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
-- well aren't you --
I don't want to fight, George.
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
Baby, don't do this --
How?
... well I'm glad you told me.
-- yes.
George...
Stop it.
What're you here for?
No.
It's an unusual trade.
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
... she's very upset...
This really ought to be layered...
Sit down.
I wanna hear about it.
Was it me, did you have something against me?
Did they have something against me?
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.
Want a drink?
Have a drink.
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
Me!
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.
You're home.
I'm coming over.
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
Yes.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
I'd like a drink.
Here.
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
That's right.
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
I am? I mean why?
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
I thought you said things were great with George.
-- Yeah, honey...
He does?
C'mon.
-- uhh-huhh...
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
But why Egypt?
Sort of.
-- why?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
What's wrong?
-- I'll get in the back --
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
Do you have something against traveling?
No!
No of course not.
Everything okay, son?
Dad?
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
Who's Tony?
Yes.
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
It's so pretty.
I won't make any noise.
Danny?
How did he manage to do that?
I'm afraid it's advocaat sir.  It tends to stain.
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
No.
She eh... interferes.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
What'll it be?
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.
No charge?
Get him out of here?
You mean just leave the hotel?
Yes...
I just want to go back to my room.
Stay away from me,
Stay away from me!  Please...
Stay... stay away!
Wendy...
Give me the bat.
Have any trouble finding us?
Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
five months of peace is just what I want.
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
Well, obviously some people can be
Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
What time does the plane leave?
Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Jane... you don't have to do that.
I've been hearing noises in there.
Rattling. Rustling.
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
Was it a prescription?
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
It could have been anything, Marty.
I saw what I saw.
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
What if I say no?
I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again.  Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.
LET THY SPIRIT
How come?  Sister?
You are so damn sexy.
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
What? 
You bastard!
Thanks.  A lot.
Sure.
She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.
Oh, girls.
This prom is a real drag.
Oh my! 
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
Jackpot!  Two buckets
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
Hopeless I
Babies
She's a pro.
What?  What does she want now?  I did the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why can't people share?
Three years.  A rookie.
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
Bobs
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... thank-you gift.
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
You were unhappy?
The reason?
I see.
And all those like you.
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...
You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
What's wrong with my life?
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
Really catching on.
You're my Olympic event.
A vote?
You sent for me?
What?
But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
I just need a few more weeks,
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
I am?
Really?  Lieutenant?
You're not... seeing anybody?
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
Hey, girls.
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
Then one day they find you.
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
A nun?
Well?
Get her!
I can't see anything in here!
You didn't shoot!
Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
Yes, Mary Patrick?
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
Peace on Earth.
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
He's not like other guys.
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
She's... she's a nun.
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
Certainly not.
They spend two days in chains.
He is a behemoth.
The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
Your superiors are two days away!
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
Very few, if any.
The Widow Windsor.
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
Listen to what you say....
I manage fine alone.
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
Are you familiar with magnets?
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
What good is this?
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
What books?
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
Climb up!
What can we do?
My suitor?
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
Thank you.  No.  Here...
What are you on about?
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
Blood.
What... what are you doing... ?
Quickly, close it.
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
I know you saw me.
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
Go home.
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?
There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, "Boy this water's cold." Old boy from Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep too."  Get it? That's a goodun.
We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
Thank ye.
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe.
He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.
Yeah.
About a half a mile I think it is.
Yeah.
You know what we ought to do tonight?
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?
You like that Vaughan?
What's in your bag?
Don't hit that boy no more.
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He's my new friend. But I feel like I've always known him. I thought you should meet him.
But maybe just for awhile --
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
They still around, your folks?
Who did you kill?
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
What you readin'?
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
It was fun, anyhow.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
Yes sir.
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends.
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
You all right, Mama?
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
You walk fast, don't you?
That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
Yeah.
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
Naw, I ain't.
I done et just a little bit ago.
Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.
He just got out of the state hospital.
What about me?
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
Will he be supervised?
Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
Will that be cash or charge?
And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
I didn't know you took pictures.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
They're all the same.
What do you mean?
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
No, he's not. You are.
It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.
So what did he say when he called?
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
Two, right?
Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
I'm all ears.
Did you ever go back to see her?
Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
So you're just going to give up and go home?
Still, you can't just write her off.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
And you're giving it to me?
For keeps?
There's just one thing I want to know.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
A little. Not much.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's what we call a paradox. Are you following me?
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
Hi there, little brother.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.
Mostly what.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
Here and there. Around.
Yeah, that's right.
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
That's it. Just the two rooms.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias. 
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
Two or three nights.
Appreciation for what?
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
Celebrate? What for?
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
It is.
Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare.  Even though it was too large f...
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
We discussed that.  And decided not to.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
My mom.  Would be the problem.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
Well, what then, sergeant?
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
Yes.  Initially.
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
I did.  Boy.
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
That's when he fell.
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
You wouldn't even see it move.
Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...
And what's that?
You think that <u>is</u> the truth.
Does it now?
You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
For certain, no.
Are you absol...
I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?
I beg your pardon.
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
You're welcome.
Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?
Okay. 
- so the one-legged jockey said - 
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
What happened?
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
But suppose he loses?
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
You've flipped your wig!
We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...
My name is Josephine.
Men?
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
What happened?
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
What is it, young lady?  What are you staring at?
Oh, he does!
What happened?
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
Hey - these are real diamonds.
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
OH!
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
And you've got cold feet.
I'm not that sick.
You all right?
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
We better have a drink first.
And bring the cocktail shaker.
I'll carry the instruments.
I'm a what?
Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.
What for?
I always did.
Brand new.
We could dye our hair.
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
You must be quite a girl.
About that roadhouse -
Daphne...
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
Anything today?
What's the job?
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.
Well, here we are.
Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
Running away?  From what?
You can't trust those guys.
Really?
You don't say?
Men!
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
What's happened?
Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Your view of what?
I'm not interested at all.
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
- and always the same Four Hundred.
You collect shells?
Well, I guess I'd better go -
The most wonderful thing happened -
Guess!
One of whom?
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
Been waiting long?
I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.
What a beautiful fish.
Look at all that silverware.
Where's your shell collection?
What's on Thursdays?
You mean we're alone on the boat?
What thing?
You mean - like frigid?
Have you tried?
Complete washout.
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
I think you're on the right track.
You're not?
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
Too bad, Charlie.  You would have had three eights.  Goodbye, Charlie!
I dont think I can go through with this.
You know all that if these walls could talk stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
Youd better get going. My parents will be round to cart you off to the country.
Does Kat know?
Wheres Nick sleeping?
Moms refining her strategy for DDay.
Whats going on with you two?
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
I thought you said you were crap.
Ill just check into a hotel.
Whats his problem?
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
Thats when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
I didnt deserve her back then.
Ah, a philosopher.
Crikey.
Seeing you again....
Its called character. God, youre predictable.
Its the past. Its nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then lets go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
Im sorry?
Hi. Hey.
What color are my shoes?
You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when theyre naked.
Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macram.
That wont be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
What?
What is?
How did you know that was me?
Would you grab my shampoo?
And you thought Id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
I swear. I dont have a signature move.
Come on.
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
Im sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
Yeah. You?
Fourteen and hes hoodwinked by a an erector set?
I should go.
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You havent visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
Oh, no. He told you.
You pawned it.
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
That does it...
And the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk?
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
You think about your father a lot, don't you?
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
Go on...
Can you swim?
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
You learnin' anything at that school?
Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
It's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. If I had the strength I'd knock down these damn walls -- if I could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us, son?
What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?
Mornin', son...
Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...
What's your daddy's name?
When's that?
I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.
What is it, David Lee?
Poor creature...
But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
Good night, Mama...
I wish you wouldn't take the dog with you, David -- he's likely to be a burden to you.
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
Whatcha got there?
Well, let me have it.
Mama, what was we laughin' for?
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
You ready to eat?
How's the weather out there?
Well, let's get to work!
Where you goin'!?
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
What... are you?
NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!
Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
Is it Cartman's mom?
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?
Suck my balls.
I can't believe he's dead.
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
Hey Cartman.
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
Your behind?
Did you bring the pie and punch?
Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
The N word?
Oh yeah.
Viva la Resistance.
MMMMMPHPHPHPHP!!!!!
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
What's a butfor?
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
It's so very cold...
How can they do this?
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
Wow, a lot of people showed up.
Oh, brother.
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
You'd fuck your uncle!
Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
Oh, you are such a maroon!
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
What's going on Terrance?
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
Who's my cream puff?
It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
This is the millennium, Saddam! This is Armageddon! There's more to life than sex!
<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-</b>
What if I just left?
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Wendy?
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
What is it?
You don't have watches?
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
So...
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
So, are you on for the next one?
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
I think I can handle it.
That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
It's time we lock coordinates.
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
We're going to die.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
Yeah.  We did it.
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
Explosive?
Taylor?
Dawn!  Dawn!
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck.
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.
In that case, I accept.
Thank you.
So I've been told.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
Where's Taylor?
I'm homesick.
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
How is it looking, Mac?
You have orange whips?
Sorry about your loss.
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Yeah, basement bingo.
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.
Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.
- canker sore.
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
Buzz Fazeli.
Need some advice, huh.
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
What about bowling?
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
My poor baby!
Don't tell me, John.
It depends.
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.
Grasp firmly. Then what?
What's your specialty?
Business.
Mind if I cut in?
Do you have a girlfriend?
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
You told Junior that we did it.
Where are you going?
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
Lips still for sale?
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
Very good, busyboy.
Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
Hold on --
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
They told me about sixty hours.
Nice work, Captain sir.
Fifty yards and closing.
Where is it?
What was that?
Increase positive pressure!
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
How deep is he?
See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
Extraordinary, isn't it?
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
They pressurize us with helium.
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
Harry's missing.
But sir --
I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
You think he killed Edmunds?
What the hell?  It shut us down.
Any sign of Harry?
Nothing, sir.
I did.
No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
You don't know that.
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
I'd also like it noted --
What <u>about</u> a crowbar?
Ted, get her away from the door.
Look at this.
It's not talking, it's mimicking.
What is that?
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
Norman!
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
What?  Why...
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
You fixed my suit?
But I don't know how --
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
Wait a second --
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
Page 87.
"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
It's for motion sickness.
Ulcers.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
P-a-r-a-s-o...
What's that?
It's like a sleeping pill?
Three to six hours.
The sphere looks different.
Shut up, Beth --
Beth --
Don't, Beth.  Please.
Beth!
Stop it!
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
You hear that?
Get away from me!
What are you looking for?
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
Just in time, too.
What?
You're staring at me.
You sound defensive.
Our answer.
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
Norman, where are you?
What do you mean?  She's not here?
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
She's cracking, Norman.
Did I kill her?
Hold on.
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
Gimme a second --
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
No, not anymore.
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?
Good morning!
Who are you anyway?
I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
What's wrong?  What's happening?
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.
Who's the pilot?
I found it... It's just not there.
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
I think she's going to be all right.
Watch it!  Move back.
You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
No need, everything's under control.
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
See Threepio... do you copy?
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
You rich kids... are all the same !
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
Are you alright ?
I'm all ears.
Profile's wrong... there.
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
Where are you going ?
Good for you.
She's flying starships !
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
None at all... We won.
Are you the boy for me ?
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
You're late.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!
What ?
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
It stinks, you goin.
...CUT OFF !
Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?
Is that your signature, Rico ?
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
Best in the Fleet !
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.
Can you walk ?
How bad are you, pal ?
You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?
Mister Rasczak ?
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.
Sergeant, secure the boat !
Where is Lt. Ilia?
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
Yes.
Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our functions better.
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
    , if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>; the plan must be implemented upon arrival.
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
Hello, Ilia.
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
Viewer ahead.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...
We're losing the pattern...!
Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.
Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
What answers?
Not for us?
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
Transporters Room and Chief Engineer Scott report trans- porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally, sir.
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
Cal...
He have any special dietary requirements...?
Go you Huskies?
You're doing a <u>Play</u>...
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
You haven't heard of it.
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
Could you tell me when's the next train?
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  That's the truth.  The truth's best, don't you think?
How can you <u>say</u> that?
No, I don't...
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Gonna' be good as new.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
What's the scene...
Ah.  Ah.  Ah...
That's right...
Hi.
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
Lookit that, up already.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
I'm glad you asked...I'll <u>tell</u> you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now:  You want to bring <u>business</u> into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, <u>no</u>...
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
I wasn't doing business.
He works on the movie.
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
What courthouse?
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
Wat...
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
Because, because...we don't <u>have</u> to build an Old Mill -- they <u>have</u> an Old Mill -- <u>yeah</u>.  It's on a stream -- that's where you <u>put</u> a mill.
It's Marty on the Coast -
...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...
That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?
Mornin, sister.
The prices are going up.
Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?
Are you all right...?
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
You guys had better leave us a...
What's his name?
You can't treat me like this.  I'm not a child!
You have to hide.
Will you help me out...?
...we had a script conference...
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
What...?
You can't do what?
What?
And you know what...?
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
Doug, the traffic light...
...he's the producer of the movie.
Arrest him.
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
I...
And what was it you wanted to say?
I'm looking for the writer.
I had a witness I would.
Who's White...?
He saw the accident...?
I...
I...
I'm very sorry I...
...the finest people you could ever hope to work with...  You have the new Old Mill pages?
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
Grace...
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
I can't.
Why?
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
<u>Siddown</u>!
You can't write it?
What did you say to them...?
You didn't see it...
It's lovely.
You cool the broad out?
What's in all the bags?
Marty...
<u>Find</u> it.
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
Yeah?
Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  It's the Mayor, he's saying...
Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone.
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
Zat true?
We have to lose the window.
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol...
Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the shower.  What did you think that was about?
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
So why are you asking me?
Look she's upset --
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
Actually.  I could only help him.
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
This is my house too!
What if he's kidnapped?
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play.
No.  I think it's ugly.
In high school.
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're late.  You're really late.  Now get out here and have some cereal.
But you told us to starve.
Excuse me --
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
IS THAT YOU?
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
Poof!  You're happy now.
Mommy?
I'm fine, ba...
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
It's not good enough.
And when did that pass?
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
Me too.
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
Machines do not EAT message.
I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
I have a snoop.
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
I'm sorry, I just...
What about obsessively picking her split ends?
Jackie?
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
You bet you are.
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
I really look like shit.
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
And I'm going to win.
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all of a sudden...  Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
We have the kids.  Next weekend.
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
It's forever you know.
She's not gonna die.
Restless.
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
You know...Stanley...
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
We're not ready.
We're not ready!
Twinkeys!
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.
Was anyone in my room today?
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
Reconceive.
Fuck!
I dunno.
So? How was school today?
Whaddya wanna talk about?
OK.
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
You're welcome.  Dad?Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Hello, Vi.
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
No, not really.
I hate reading.
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
That's good. So then what do you do now?
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Huh. Kids?
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
OK. Bye.
Is it loaded?
You know...I like you.
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Doubt it.
Prnceton.
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
I'll lead.
Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?
What are we going to do!
What now?
Let's move it we got company!
Forget about it.
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
What do you mean?
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!
Well Filmore--
How well do you know this place?
Go fuck yourself...
I insist...
Well?
Good.
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
What about Cooper--where is he?
This was taken when Richter was arrested in Washington state, 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking, skipped bail, and has since been a fugitive.
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
How goes the roll call?
Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.
What's happening at the waterfront?
Good.
Agreed--let's move it.
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Just what the hell is he talking about?
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 
What are you talking about, Major?
Get a grip on yourself, Major!
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
That about right?
Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
Yes, sir.  But so do we.
Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
Look, he's there, and you're here.
Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff.
I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
War.
Just the missiles.
Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
Roger.
Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
No kidding.
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.
What's your point, Lothar?
Where'd they get you?
He's dead, all right.
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
Who's that?
I thought I'd go along for the ride.
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
We are?
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
In Group?
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
Yeah!
Uh, home, you know.
Yup.
Yeah.
Do you wanna go to the van?
It's your birthday?
Jesus Christ.
I'd get bored.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
You know what we should do? Go to the...
Good.
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
Wait. Hey, man.
Ah, you know people there?
Pony? What's a "pony"? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.
Hey, man.
Am I fucking him?
It's safe, come on.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
No, but I heard it was great.
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
I'd like to.
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
Erica.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
Mm.
I'd love to read that.
Um, mother-daughter.
Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. "The greatest men are the most alone." And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.
Yes.
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
I don't know.
No.
Why we're just standing here.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Nazeer what?
Oh! Trim it!
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
Okay, what would you have done.
How?
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
Come with me.
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
No, I don't.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Do your covers and all that shit.
You really suck, you know that?
Hey, Pony.
Good, man.
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
No, it's not...
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
The prom. That's funny.
Sorry.
Really?
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Get off my roof!
Ready?
I hope you're happy!
No, this has everything to do with you.
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
So? What's L.A. like?
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
Would I get paid?
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
No, I'm going.
Soon.
Yeah.
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.
Oh, How'd she get back?
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
Your manager?
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
Hey!  Rule number one - never take off the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
Di, we're sorry.  We...
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
... I don't know.  Probably not.
-- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo.
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.
Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me."  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain.
Jack, I think I should get a job.
If you reach for the stars, you're bound to get -- mm-Jack, pull over.
Oh... What are you working on?
I'm sorry.
...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.
Nope.  Sounds more like the first.
Madonna.
Hat-trick?
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it.
... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
Hannah, we've...
Screw Lucy!
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.
You got that big retarded girl down there?
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
You shouldn't smoke so many of those.
Your help.
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
Good party.
Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?
Name dropper.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
Well....
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
Betty, there's no use running out on it.  Let's face it, what- ever it is.
From Artie.  What's wrong?
You bet.
Hers.
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
You're a writer, you said.
Are you or aren't you?
Who else ?
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
It's getting kind of late --
You'll like it here.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?
The other guests?
What are the notes?
Keep it.
What's the matter with you?
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
He must be quite a guy.
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
That's a lie!  They still want me!
Wanted what?
I'm the greatest star of them all.
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.
That's what I told them.
Whose room was this?
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
How's that about your being my friend?
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
Bring something to drink.
Paramount is calling.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
Why did she have to show up now?
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
At last. Ultimate Power.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
We can't do that.
We're from different worlds.
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
You're not afraid are you?
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
Away. From you.
Wait. Don't leave me.
And you can see how you feel about me, right?
She's right. They'll string her up.
A little.
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
I bet they do.
Oh no, not you again.
Why should I believe you?
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
Someone's chasing him.
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
Superman will return it.
What's a tree?
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
She did that deliberately.
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
Don't you believe in knocking?
What can I do for you?
I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
Nothing's wrong with my skin.
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
Shouldnt've done that.
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
Others?
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
It's lovely. . .
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Brad?
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
Peanut butter and jelly.
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
I can never get a way from it.
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
Do you really know Superman?
Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
Dishwasher? Any luck?
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
How do you do that?
Hey, boss.
It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.
And then shut down the pipe lines.
Everything.
Anything.
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
Hey, you're perfectly safe.
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
Who's the other woman?
What about you?
Why do I have to do this?
What terrific story?
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
I thought you'd never get here.
I don't know you, lady.
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
53.
Okay? Goodbye.
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
It could make weather!
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
So?
Hostages?
Actually, yes.
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
Maybe I could try --
It is kinda romantic.
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .
I didn't think I wanted to.
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
Mush!  Mush!
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
Why didn't you go before we left?
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
Where?
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.
Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
Superman! The --
Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
You're late. Very late.
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
No Paris?
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
And what do we get out of it?
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
Yes, darling?
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
What's that?
Whoa. . .
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
The one Superman wrecked up?
Hey! Just remember I made you.
I am an experiment? I am freako?
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
A hot story, huh?
Do you know where you're headed?
Your bookie?
Hey!
It wasn't a trick!
Is that what they're calling him?
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
Damn!  This will get him.
Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.
Mr. Romance...
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
You got wax in your ears?
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
Boy!
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
You've been doing some research in the archives.
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
Who...who...
Superman???
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Can you really see through anything?
What color underwear am I wearing?
There.
What's the matter, Otis?
I broke the man out of prison --
I gave him this new face.
I still don't get it.
This is California. The richest, most populous state in America. And growing like a sonofagun.
It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --
Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
Yes...fine.
Which one?
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
She's in trouble?
Alison.
I hope she gets better.
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
How is Nicole?  Is she around?
Because it's what we have to do.
I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
What time's he coming home?
Yes.
Your kids never cry.
Good night, Billy.
About the Ottos?
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
That's what he said, is it?
It's for the school bazaar.
So do you like your new room?
Is this mine?
Nicole!
No.
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
Dolores.
Why?
When?
What do you mean?
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
News?
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
Do you have the blood test?
Oh God, I'm scared.
We do.
I'm a lawyer.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
You think someone else caused the accident?
So you're just the thing we need.
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
Yes.
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
Why were you scared?
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
Of course.
Pretty slick, eh?
It's because of the accident, Nicole.  Most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers.  A lot of people...well, people in this town are very angry. Us included.
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.
Yes.
Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
Will you mind your own business!
Where are we running?  What am I missing here?
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  Just give us the punch line...
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you?
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.
Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
Can I come out?  No.
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line!  What about that big rumpus in my office today?  You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!
What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!
I thought he would.
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned.
Is Frank D'Angelo around?
You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you "interviewed"?
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?
A girl needs a little romancing before she -
What would you think of me if -
That's the third time he's called today.
But...
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
Did you send my folks in Philly the check...?
I'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what I said - I said you snoop.  For instance, what were you doing around my hotel the other night?
It's a habit with me.  So now I'm briefed.  So what?
Why me...?
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
We stick in each others craw.
Where do you come off to make a remark like that?
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
Don't run away - I was always the man for you!  I'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what I say!  Inside of six months -
J.J., if you think -
I tried to reach you twice -
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
I made you write a beautiful song...
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
Please... let... the kids... go...
We should abort.
My God.
Radical.
Can I stop by my house?
You sure?
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Everything.
Affirmative.
Excellent.
Not even of dying?
Torque wrench please.
You will.
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
No!
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
It must end here... or I am the future.
Mom?  You okay?
I love you.  I always will.
I know!
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
I have detailed files.
And no elbows on the table!
I guess so, sir.
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
Yes, David?
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwngler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.'  And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit.
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwngler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
You live here, in Berlin?
Think you can get me any of that?
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
Did you call someone you knew?
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
What did Goering say?
If it's too hot, open your tie.
When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
Yes, I know who he is.
That's an outrageous lie!
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
I have no idea.
I'm sorry.
Okay, so what is it?
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwngler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
Can you handle it?
Anything else?
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
Great.
Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?
Do you understand?
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
Reese...you got a first name?
I caught one, back there.
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
You volunteered?
You'll learn.
About what?
Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.
Hot dogs?
He'll find us, won't he?
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
What are you doing?
I don't think I like this.
What are you doing?
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Why were the other two women killed?
You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me?
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?
You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.
Are you finished?
Did you play recently?
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
Pardon me... Miss... ?
I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
See you around.
Don't even think about it.
There goes a thousand dollars.
Nice.
Okay.
Do you mind if I sit?
Want anything to drink?
What are you doing... ?
You can talk while I drive us to the police.
That's a lie...
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...
What?
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
Originally, Connecticut.
One brother, one sister.
Yes.
Hey there, Nickie.
Happy Birthday, man.
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
About me?
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
For you.
Call that number.
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
Tell me you'll call.
Will you?
But, will you?
Yeah, almost...
What have they been doing to you?
Split it?
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Where?
You know, these fit... perfectly.
I've been so lonely.
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
Goodnight.  See you home.
What's this about?
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
The Hinchberger wedding.
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
Anything wrong... ?
Attractive...
What's happened...
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
And those are Luke's and mine.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
It's not going to hold your weight.
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
Are you working with her?
I, I just can't...
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
Sorry.
What did it smell like?
I don't know.
What is that tune?
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts.
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
She needs help.
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.
I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
What do you want?
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
What did it cost?
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
How could he have left without his keys?
Watts?
My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?
Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> --  -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley.  And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney.  He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
What'd you come back for, babe?
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Italian.
I like the colors.
We think someone is here.
When you find the guy, you'll know.
You should have let me do the talking.
You think I'm staying?
I can take care of the paperwork.
CQ what?
Who done it, then?
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
You're kiddin' me, right?
Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
That was one of them?
Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.
What d'you say, Elaine?
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
Had a feeling it was you.
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
Said it went on for donkey's years.
I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me.  She was always so embarrassed.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
You don't seem bothered.
Overnight.  What about just now?
Only in the movies.
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
Not that I recall.
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
Of the deal, man.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
Where is he now?
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
What?
You do?
Like what.
How we gonna get that lucky?
How'd you get in here.
He's expecting you?
So why would he want to see you.
You've made it ... brighter.
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
Pleasure.
Ann--
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
But more or less.
...No, please.
Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
No problem!
...You bring a check?
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is--
...Ed, I...
Uh-huh.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
...Oh, Jesus.
Please, Ed.
...What kind of man *are* you?
Where you going?
...What a knucklehead.
...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--
OK, how did you know?
...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Jesus...
...You sure, Eddie?
Frank.
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
You don't got a headache?
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
'Lo, Ed.
Mr...?
Yes, sir.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
His eyes are open.
Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
I'll go down and speak to him.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
Behind you.
For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
Lieutenant --
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
If you don't mind, this could be important.
I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
What does it say?
What's that doing here?
Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --
This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
Margo, these aren't seed pods.
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
What do you make of it, Margo?
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."
How does it work?
How did you know that?
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
Where would we find it?
What happened?
It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --
We're not going to make the storage room!
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.
It's the busy season.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
Why is he in the basement?
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
Cue music...
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
Are we talking Emmies?
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
Nothing was real.
What's he doing?
How can they have a child?
You take Japanese.
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
No...I, er.
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
Marlon--
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
What're we doing here, Truman?
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
Every time you and Marlon--
This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this now and then.  Come to bed.
What're you doing down here?
I know.
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.
That's right.  I do, don't I?
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
How's your hip?
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown.  We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
--Darling--
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?
How's it going, Truman?
See you tomorrow, Truman.
Not supposed to talk about it.
Well, we're FBI agents.
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
You've been back to Dallas?
We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
This man's still alive.
Do they know?
Do I know you?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
Those people were already dead.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
What was it?
You found something?
Why?
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
What did you find?
What kind of infection?
This looks like new grass to you?
Where would they be going?
Been where?
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
What? What happened?
I can't go any farther.
On whose orders?
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
Agent Mulder --
What are you doing?
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
Why are you telling me this?
The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
Don't bring it home in this.
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
Nothing.
The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?
Is it cold in here?
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
This is Stargher we're talking about?
What happened?
He's mine?
What now?
Who says?
Oh no... No you don't.
Already there.
When did he lapse into the coma?
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
Nervous?
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
Is she alright?
So?
The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
You were in love with him, weren't you?
I don't know. They didn't answer.
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.
What's she talking about?
Tell me about him.
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
Let's not get into any more trouble.
Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
What happened to your hand?
...you know.
...Headquarters.
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
...Austrian Police Headquarters.
Did you ever hear of "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"
Him dying like that.
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
Listen, Callaghan.
Do you see what that means?
I suppose you don't believe me.
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
Calloway!
A girl of spirit.
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
Be sensible, Martins.
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?
Very good, sir.
Heard of Harry Lime?
Seems exciting.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
What's that?
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.
Zane Grey.
Mr. Crabbin.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
Striptease, sir.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
Hmm.
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
...you.
Are you mad?
Martins.
Could he have been at all conscious?
Speak English?
...give evidence.
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
What else did he tell you?
Mr. Martins...
What's the purpose of your visit here?
Where are you staying?
I'll share something with you.
I don't know - I'm American.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
Everyone ok?
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.
What about Moliere?
Francoise -
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
Exactly.
No one follows that midrash.
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
What, do you like it here?
You coming?
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
Are they still together?
Is he a Nazi?
What's he care about?
I'm coming to your room tonight.
Do you know it like that? By heart.
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
It looks a little like a swastika.
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny Balint...? We met at that...[meeting at your house.]
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
Leo Strauss...  I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye.
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Explain it so I can.
I don't think you know what you are.
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
I thought you hated Torah.
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
It was a nine millimeter.
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
No!
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
Get out of here....
Which one were you aiming at?
If I went back to the lumberyard, the guy'd give me all the dynamite I wanted. Untraceable, you wouldn't -- need to...
It's not going to be fine. It's --
You remember Miriam....
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
You missed on purpose.
And what did you do?
It's Friday....
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
Do you think I...
May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
It can't be true!
He seems to have won it.
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
Well, good night, then...
... It's a comfortable place.
The Mamma's there too.
He can learn.  He is learning.
How did it happen?
Ten thousand.
Dollars.
Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
Plenty of women everywhere right?
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
You're the best, Enzo!
That's good.
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
Enzo?
Why?  Are they what's most important?
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
He doesn't like us.
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
But what brought you to Sicily?
No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.
You look adorable.
You jumped in?
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
I'm going back home.
Then, tell me a story.
I'm being a pain, huh?
You sure?
Jacques...?
You've got to tell me what happened?
Promise me one thing.
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
... And the new stereo.
It's his heartbeat.
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
What are they for?
... And those?
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
It was a trap. I'm back at square one.
Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
So why the long face?
There won't be any need for that sir.
So. Do you have a name?
That got annoying fairly quickly.
Sorry. I'm better with men.
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
But we're not open on Sundays.
Cool. What's it do?
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
How do we bypass it?
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
What are you doing?
What should I charge?
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
My soninlaw. What do you think of him?
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and -
This is for "mama and the kids."
Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
They don't say it to me.
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
It's a blackcard and bad card, but not the card of the cat - not the card of fourfooted things.
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
Something black - something on its way to you 
Don't look at it!
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches 
Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't 
Show business?
It's about the leopard.
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
Doc -- something you said the other day --
Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.
It could be a man.
There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.
Then you found the leopard --
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
Wait 
Get it out of here!
That's easy. Me.
You're too good to me.
Who was the other man?
Who is he?
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --
No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says closed to the public, doesnt it?
Thats right.
Good afternoon. De Moraess residence.
I wont comment on the time but youll understand if I dont tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard. 
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You dont mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is hes either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But Ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why Im here at such a late hour. I need 20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.
How dare you...  You dont know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
You lost my money?
Im impressed. That information could have cost me 20,000.
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
Ive had a long and unpleasant day. Im tired and Im angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leons boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
What do you mean, No, Mrs De Moraes?
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. Youd have been ready for me when I turned up with Sleeping Beauty. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. Not Leon, you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didnt say My God!, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. Not Leon. Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman Id stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at 15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didnt you?
One just doesnt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
I dont.
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?
Where is that?
Dont you believe in simplicity?
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
So you did talk about it, huh?
Theres nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
Okay. The woman just cant walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why cant you go to your Embassy?
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why cant you go back there?
Its give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didnt really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang.
Then find another way.
...Im Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this thats who I am. Do you get what Im fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
Shit! Fuck! Whats fucking wrong with people!  Im going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
Im calling about the puppies.
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
So, what are you looking for?
On the bed!
Where is the Austrian?
Where are we?
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
Whats the Ambassador?
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?
Oh... We split up.
I came to feed your fish. I didnt know...
Hello there. Hows the flat. I cleaned...
Id appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you cant, dont worry about it. Ill call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but Im in a hurry. 
Good afternoon, Mrs...?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
I take it your son is called Leon?
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
Check with your sons bank. Banks dont usually give out information about their customers.
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
Any friends?
The 1,000 is on account.
The rooms yours for 24 hours. Its sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
Vous tes Franais?
Problems?
Am I supposed to know him?
Clients come and go.
Is it real?  You people are sick.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Maybe I dont.
What is?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
And while visiting our fair city you...  An Austrian?
Im sorry...
This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.
A private investigator... Youre not Austrian?
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
I cant think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. Whats your sisters number?
Whats the date?
Ive been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You dont know Leon, do you?
Okay, shitbag. Im only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Three...
Why did you kill him?
Are you telling me Friedman didnt tell you I was here looking for him?
So why didnt he?
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
Why not you -- Jean d'Aulon?  The only man who's poorer than I am, and so the only man I can trust. Dignified, honorable, wise... what more could we ask of a king?
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
Jeanne, stop it!
What did they say?
What's going on?!
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
The king said you're his finest archer...?
Jeanne...!  Are you alright?
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
To be killed in battle?
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
I am ready now...
I'm already free...
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
One day you will.
No...
Go onto the next question.
Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
Yes, but...
Who's running this trial, you or her?  I can't believe it!  This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?
Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
Dead you're worthless, darling.
Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?
Were you baptized?
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?
Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...
What were you doing when the voice came?
Please... may I have it back...
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
Thanks be to God.
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.
What was my mission?  To help my country?  But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
So how would you put it?
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
Your majesty, I really think you...
You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
So... what is the message?
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
Stand by with the battering-rams...
Well...?  Shall we go?
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
And you didn't jump of your free will?
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
What are you doing out here?
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
Are you going to leave me too?
There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...
But you already confessed this morning...
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Is that bad?
Beautiful.
I don't want to wait for his call.
Someone you know?
Sit.
I need help.
And how's Yurek?
Will I still be able to play?
Calm down, what, what is it?
Halina?
Funny time to say this.
wish I knew you better.
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
Mama, that was a great dinner.
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
What are you reading?
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
Why didn't you come to me?
Pig!
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
Out of Warsaw.
What's your work?
Where are you hiding?
Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done.  You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea! 
Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave.
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
I worry for you.
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
No, words. You have never heard words?
Everyone has to practice.
What did she say?
Oh no, it can't come now.
And when is the next lesson?
He's given it to us.
All right if I look around your lobby?
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
I'm out, Johnny.
Then why ain't he dead?
Buck Duff.  I was in Maxwell's boost in Troy.
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
Name's Danny McCoy.  No Neck McCoy we called him.  Runs a few protection rackets for Carnello while he's waiting for something bigger to come along.  Me and Danny been friends since we were six. Take a good look at that face, Floyd, cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us, you'll have to kill him and every other hood in Chicago who'd like to do the same thing.  You understand what I'm sayin'?
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
How'd ya do?
No.
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie.  How much cash we got?
Looks like he's sulking.
I'm not sure I know it.
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
How ya doin'?
I guess I left it in my room.
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
It isn't any better.
You got a back door to this place?
What does this guy want?
Hooker!
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
So could Shaw.
What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?
You're dreamin', kid.
And you were gonna pay me back?
You really picked a winner, kid.
Well, what did I tell ya?
What happened?
Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
You weren't hired to miss him.
We'll take it.  You manage the building at the end of the alley?
Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
What about this Rosebreen?
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
She's got me worrying, too.
How are you?
Well!
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
What is it?
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
Then what are you hiding?
I don't believe it! You're lying!
Oh!
Mother!
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
Dead?
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
This is my wedding.
Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
How's your brother?
Shrapnel!
How'd you people happen to pop in?
I never saw him before.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
What about this Nunheim?
Could this be him?
Well....
He telephoned me today.
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
What kind of clothes was he wearing?
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
I can't! I haven't got it!
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
I've done that already. He should appear, you know.  It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
Why do you say that?
What am I?  The fall guy?
You got types?
By the way, how is your father's side?
Isn't that my drink?
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
No.
You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
So am I.
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
You're going to drive me crazy!
Bonds, sir?
Where are you going?
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
They stopped.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
Not much of a pass.
What about it?
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
Just keep quiet.
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
At-at-at-at-at.
This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
You think?
Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
Now this is war.
Take the binoculars.
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
Oh, God!  Oh God!
It's a mine, isn't it?
How's this going to work?
Where the hell is it!?
They're going to kill us!
A whole lot of nothing.
Why do I have to stay down here?
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
I don't want to die.
Sorry.
What do you think our chances are?
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
What do you figure it is?
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.
What did you say?
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
What do you make of them?
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
Epps.
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
People are suffering.
He says it's a box.
You get it yet?
You will.  You'll get it.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
We...we could go home with something else.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
Iraqis.
Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
Yeah!  Yeah!
We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.
You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
It's got a bottom.
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
You're going to burn up in those.
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?
HUMMMM.....
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
When?
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.
They're watching us now.
Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away?  Economically, it's not sound at all.  Very much unlike....
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
Not very encouraging.
I've got it!  Astounding!
I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here..
Right now.
Which way?
I knew him.
She's not there
No...no you're wrong.
I'm sorry.
Just look at all those people.
Yes
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
Coffee, Mike?
Treat. We treat devices.
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
So what were they doing here?
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
Right.
You guys seem pretty tight.
Why do you do it?
So cut both.
It's working.
Ex-girlfriend?
How do you know?
Fuck factor?
Keep talking.
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
What do you think?
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
Who are you calling, sis?
What about the ballistics report?
I'm filing charges against that mother-
He is!
Vice... Jesus.
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
Oh shit...
You okay?
P.E.T.N ...
Vice cop on a homicide?
A what?
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
Nice to be here.
Captain...
It's our only option.
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.
No.
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
Like it?
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
Yes, Baron.
And, waiter--you see that moon?
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
I don't want to see you at all!
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
Yes, m'sieu.
Darling!  Now tell me--tell me all about yourself. Who are you?
Monescu!
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.
Right.
The fourteenth of May.
They're all right, aren't they?
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
Now, Lily--
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company! 
Yes...?
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
Naturally I did.
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
Yes.
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!
When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
Ah, let me have a little fun.
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Mariette!
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
No, m'sieu!
But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm having a tea party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?
About what?
Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
I think you'd better go.
You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.
Didn't you take it with you?
Yes, I saw it--but--
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
How much time?
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
Who's the best? Say it.
Holy shit.
Rush her.
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
I told you you wanted to take this call.
I make my own luck.
What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
My God... Cal. Is it a --
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
But I was with him the whole time.
Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
They'll pull us right down I tell ya!
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
Mr. Dawson, I --
What's this?
And these were drawn from life?
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
Will this work?
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
It would be a nice change from you.
Hope we're not intruding.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
Good afternoon--
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
You'll excuse me. 
You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
Did you find it?
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
You're coming back--
Like her paint job?
Where have you been hiding?
How about giving me another coat?
Tell me.
Don't rub it in.
A little.
Thanks.
Mighty decent of you, pal.
What are you thinking?
Don't let's talk about it.
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
A dollar forty.
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Come in! 
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
How about you?
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
Where do you live?
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
That's me!
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
Come on, get up.  That horse is carrying too much of a load.
Oh, there you are--
Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here. 
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
He's all right.
Not because of Ned.
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
Yes, Yes!
No!
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
Everything in order, sir?  What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
So how's Tombstone treating you?
Listen, I want to talk to you.
He said to turn loose of him.
Hey, you smell that?  Smells like Something died.
I'm retired.
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.
I'm sorry.  If there was any other-
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.
That's the rumor.
Age quod agis.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
What's wrong, Doc?
Sheriff Behan, Doc Holliday.
Very instructive
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
Satisfied?
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!
I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I Literally don't care if I live or Die.  But even I can't fight human Instinct.  Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?
So what does he want?
Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"? Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".
A which?
I don't believe it.  He's clean!
You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.
What is it?
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
Doesn't suit you.
No, no, get away, get away from me...
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
Mattie.  What about this?
Well hello, Sherm.
So what about you Cowboys anyway?
Florentino!  He's getting away!
What'd you do that for?
I don't like it.
Give him some good exercise?  Sure Some stud.  Some string in fact. What're you gonna do, race 'em?
Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White.
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
We should get moving.
Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
Well we're off and running.  Just Acquired us a quarter-interest in The game at the Oriental.
Her maiden name was Sullivan.
I couldn't help it, Wyatt.  I Looked at that woman and it was Just like somebody slapping me in The face.  I mean these people're Afraid to even walk down the Street and I'm trying to make Money off it like some kind of God damn vulture.  That's not me, That's somebody I don't even know.
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
I'd rather die alone.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.
Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Your new car. 
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
Yes -
Do you feel better now?
What about the uranium?
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
That's reassuring.
Natalya?
Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
Bourbon. Neat.
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
... Do you have a gun?
Wait here.
... How did you get into marine salvage?
Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.
Sometimes you just have to -
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
And when might that be?
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
My name is Sidney Winch, and -
I was an attorney!
No.
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!
What is HE doing here?
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
Please sir. Please -
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
When are you boys going to fix that roof?
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
You okay?
I'm going back home with Harry.
Well, you just have to move further out.
Let us settle this tomorrow.
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.
I'm worn out.
How is the garden doing?
What did you put on it?
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
Man, act like this is your home.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
Harry, you know everything.
What's the problem here?
How is everybody?
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.
Those boys never did have good luck.
You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
Did you have your child at home?
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
What must I do?
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Yeah!
Can I bring some toys?
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
Yeah?!
Mom, have you seen Woody?
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
Which one can I open first?
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
Toy?
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
Sure is a hairy fellah.
Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
Well, thanks for the ride.
Ha-ha!!
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
Let's string him up by his pull- string!
No she's NOT --
Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!
Oh, no!
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Laser-envy.
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
They're getting bigger.
What the heck is up there?
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
I'm red this time.
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
You'll put your clothes here.
I want to go home.
That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
Finn ...
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
Everything is gone, now.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
Did you do this?
I appreciate you coming in so early.
I... I don't really know.
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?
This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
Did you get it?
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
Don't bother.
I think she's lying.
Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
Helena --
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
Parents still together?
In school?
Private?
That's a big word for a fisherman.
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
Are you getting this on tape?
What do you think she wants?
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
We aren't barbarians.
I don't think you're going to do that.
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone.
Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.
You will help me with my other problem.
It's no problem.  I was just with everybody we work with.
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
Javi!  Come on.  Don't pull this you don't care bullshit.  This is incredible information.  It must be. Javi --
You watch and learn.  I earn his trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear with kindness.  Within a week he will follow me around like a dog.
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers.  At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?
What?
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
Hello.
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
Did you tell him?
I'm sorry.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
And remember, Rents: no skag.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.
Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.
Where are you going, Diane?
Where's that?
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Holding hands?
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
What do you want?
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
So, what's he like?
What happened?
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.
Are you getting out much?
Have you got any gear on you?
You Only Live Twice?
Director?
The park?
It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.
Why?
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
That's hardly a substitute.
What's on the menu this evening?
And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?
Sounds great, Swanney.
It's fresh air.
What do you see as your main strengths?
Homeless people?
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
Qual se tu?
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
Admit it. We're lost.
Sulu, what are you doing?
Following new course. Warp seven.
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
What's going on?
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
No, but you can bet they will.
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
Not General Korrd.
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
Spock.
What is this?
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
Spock...  What have you done to my friends?
What makes you think I won't turn us around?


They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
I don't understand...
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Dillinger?
Flynn had Group 7 access.
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
For what?
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.
Yeah...?
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
That all you can say?
Oh. Anything else?
Meanwhile, he might find it.
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
User requests are what computers are for.
That was uncalled-for.
Who is your User, program?
What, just the three of us?
What's that?
You're alive!
Hey... you guys OK?
The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all.
How did you do that, Flynn?
Flynn, we've got to help him!
But... won't you be de-rezzed?
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
Hey... !
So...how's the world of serious science?
You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
Wait...I need that...
The Users...you really think they're still there?
You think we can make it there?
You've grown, big program.
Nice...
No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
You seem fine now.
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
And this is a little above market-				* rate for the horizontal bop, even				* for a total biscuit like her.
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the					* ghost numbers.  They were checking out the Renquist front.
Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
Station wagon?
What's the plan?
Copy that.
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
Yes.
Hello, Harry.
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
Uh huh.  Okay.
What did you tell him?
Uh huh.
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
Why did you continue to see him?
Would you say he was boring, then?
Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
And you agreed?
What?
I can do it!
Natasha?
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
What did he give you?
Are we going to die?
As much as you used to?
Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet.  But it's not enough.  If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle.
You working on someone right now?
What does she do?
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?
I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
And you chased one?
What is it you want me to do?
What's happened?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.
What do you want me to do?
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.
The letter I sent.
Thanks a lot.
Great movie. Action-packed!
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
I don't remember.
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
Burt Reynolds.
Turn-offs?
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
Four hundred bucks.
So he really loved her?
A real live pimp?
What did he do to Arlene?
You better not be fucking teasing me.
No no no no no no no no no...
I think what you did was...
I think what you did...
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
Live with what?
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
If I thought I could get away with it -
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
Where the fuck is that bitch?
That's a pretty amazing story.
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
This is Drexl's coke?
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
Elliot what?
The zoo.
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
What the fuck did you bring that for.
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
No. But thanks.
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
Where's everybody else?
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?
I've seen him.
On their honeymoon.
Come again?
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
That was very good.
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
Could we try it now?
That Vietnam movie?
And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.
Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.
He knows.
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
Just put it in your purse.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Yes.
Yes.
Well?
The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become "addicted" have you, Cole?  To that "dying" world'
I understand.  There'd be no point.
We're very close!  Because of you!
I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.
Change what?
James, where did you grow up?  Was it around here?  Around Baltimore?
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
They're keeping an eye on me.
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
You smell so good.
I don't understand what we're doing.
You want me to rob him?
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.
Why are we doing this?
But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.
That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
They hurt you!
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
Excuse me -- what did you say?
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
I mashed the spider, didn't I?
But you know what's real now?
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
He was fully sedated!
One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?
Nine thirty
Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Pepsi.  Pepsi ain't nothing but flavored water.
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
You don't fear death?
It's a Movado.
One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was back in July of forty-seven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
Where to?
But, in particular?
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
You own this place?
You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--
Then you're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  Now why don't you just take your Visa Express Silver Card, call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
Two-hundred.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?
What would a truck stop be without beer?
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
Who was that on the phone?
What the hell you looking at, girl?
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.
Maybe I don't want you to.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
No, I've got it.
It's nothing.  Really.
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Beautiful?
All right, Grace.  No more games.
You love him?
Did you ever?
John, please--
What are you talking about?
I could if I had Jake's money.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
John!?  What the hell's the matter with you?
John . . .?
Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.
Well, nothing.
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
John!
Husband . . .?
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
I'm a solid man.
Live there?
Hey!
Good Lord.  What happened to you?
Hungry?
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
Talk?  About what?
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
And for that you'd kill Grace?
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
You love her, but you hate her?
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
I asked you a question.
I want to stay.
Got any requests?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
Why don't you step out of the car, son?
I think you might just want to do as I say.
That's what this is all about?  A shakedown?  You picked the wrong people.  We don't have any money.
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
What?
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
More or less.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
Mister!
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass.
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
A lot that means.
I'm a solid man.
Talk?  About what?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
How much time?
Hey.
What the hell happened to my car?
Hundred-fifty.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Two-hundred.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Got any cold soda?
I call the sheriff.
I don't know your real name.
I got it.
No, I've got it.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
What do you do anyway?
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
I don't know about that?
Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.
Hope is a four-letter word.
And I love you too.
<u>Jake</u>...
The old lady?
Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mister...  if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a Western Union thing.  And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
I need a ticket.
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
Keep your change.  Bus three-twenty-three. Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.
Genuine Draft?
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25.  You try to have a nice day now, would you?
Son of a bitch!
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
Who was that on the phone?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Proceed.
Is that the entire message?
Once again please?
I'm listening.
Is Jeremy okay?
Okay.
...I can't remember.
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
I've come to a decision.
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
What's he talking about?
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
I thought he was carrying something.
Yes.
He's doing well today.
He's kind of a miracle.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
Yeah?
How much is it?
What do you do if something happens?
I'm sleeping in my room.
I know now.
I'll just shoot him once.
You like sports?
Yeah, hello.
How are you feeling?
Twelve years.
Is this a religious thing?
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
Well, go get it then.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
You told them cowboys you had it.
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
He said...
Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...
Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
He's coming ain't he?
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?
He give 'em names?
Oh. How long I been here?
Oh. Yeah.
You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife...
What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
Uh... a little, maybe.
Yeah?
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
Then... what?
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
Schofield? You from Schofield?
She's passed on, Kid.
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
They takin' water?
Say, Bill...
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
Well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
Three ways?
He musta been movin' right along.
Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here.
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
Shit.
I give it up 'cause I hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back...  Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin' bed.
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
No.
You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?
I seen him.
Worms was comin' out.
Claudia... ain't here, Bill.
Easy, Bill.
I'm goin' on down to Kansas.
Hullo, paw.
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
Fuck you.
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
His pistol must of jammed.
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
I don't kill nobody without him. 
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
There was ninety-one million -
I don't get it.
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
I know who he is.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
This is not right.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
What are we gonna do?
Me too.
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
What fence? Who?
I was out of line.
What is this?
The answer is no.
What did you say?
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
A little of both.
What do you mean I can't see him?
He won't go into the interrogation room.
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
Do you believe in him, Verbal?
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
What call?
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
You're joking.
What is the truth?
What are you doing here?
... he wants to testify ...?
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
Anything special about the case?
We went to Code Blue...
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
Objection, we've...
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
What book is that?
I did.
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that?
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
What is this going to cost?
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
I am on the staff of...
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
Dr. Gruber ...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
Thank you ...
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
Yessir.  I'm sorry.
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
What is it?
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Exception!
Continental Casualty...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
I can't guarantee that...
Pardon?
D'you find an apartment?
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth?  You want another drink?
Maybe I can do something right.
What happened...?
I've got to work...
Not if you don't grow up...
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
I have to talk to you.
...he's a good man...
They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
Today is Tuesday.  What?
What happened, Joey...?
Yes.  Yes, I have.
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...
Hi.
Another, Frank . . . ?
I want to buy you a drink.
What happened in those three minutes...?
Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
And you like it.
Like all this.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.
How can I see her, to know her?
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
Hello?
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
What do you want to know?
It's a place to live, that's all.
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
No? Then what?
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
Scottie, what are you doing?
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
Well?
Ernie's?
Come here.
We're going awfully far.
Scottie, why are we here?
But why? Why here?
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --
We're going up the tower.
Yes!
Do you remember where you were?
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
I don't know.
Do you know where you're going?
Where are you now?
What else?
Where?
I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
No, don't go away!
Go on.
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
Why?
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
Let me go into the church alone.
Is there something I can do for you?
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
Well?
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Step number two.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Pop Leibel? Sure.
The poor thing....
Out!
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
She died.
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
Well...
She's fucking hot!
Can't do what?
Name one.
The floor was wet. She slipped!
What did you say?
About anybody but yourself. You never have.
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
Go home!
She's got no fucking pulse.
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Bury her out in the desert.
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
So that's what we're doing.
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
What?
I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
Don't snap at them!
That's one idea.
Are you solid with that?
No way.
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
So. When is the wedding.
Who?
That's right.
Your investment ideas never work out.
I got her arm.
What's goosed?
He just had two.
You said that Boyd.
Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
Oh God. This is insane.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
He's cracked up.
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
Whatever you say Kojak.
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
The hell I did!
Nope.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
Are we supposed to?
This is ridiculous.
Why can't we do it through the mail?
You can't play around with these tent people.
Stop it. I'm sorry.
I just don't see him in the big picture.
That's absurd.
Do you love me?
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
Yeah. Sure.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.
Who's dead?
What?
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just...
The first day.
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
I have no idea.
Greenpeace.
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.
Yeah?
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile...
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
We will.
Fucking desert.
I'll come to you tonight.
Give them to Refugio.
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
Enedina and Paco ...
How long are you staying?
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
Come down here, you scamp.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
Let me pass!
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
How much is that?
My God, what have you done to him!
If you wake first, wake me up.
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
What are you thinking about?
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
Me, rich? Come on!
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.
You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
There's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.
He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.
Don't say that.
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
He came in through the cupboard.
In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here.
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.
What about you, Manuel?
In English, please.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
Enough to level an entire city block.
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
You know how much man power you're talking about?
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
... and you get nanodeath.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
You need a maid.
I wonder how that...
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
My God...
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
How can I ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
John died.
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it  I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
You ready for this?
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
Who said that?
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
Relax. I know what you meant.
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
Parker - stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you
He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.
That's why I'm asking.
My guess is dead.
Where's John?
The symphony of collision...
I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
You want some research, flu?  Side-effects of medi....
...on the way in.
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...
Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do.
Well, get on the phone, and <u>get</u> it...

...you want us to go to War...
Why?
<u>Who</u>?
...where is the Back End coming from?

Why do people go to war?
China.
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
Do I know you?
String a few together.  All I need's eleven,
What do you think would hold it off?
"The Country Is At War." 
They got to have something that we want.
What do we have that they want?
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
What is it?
The War ain't over. 
...this the Guy.
My prop guy, had a guy out here.
Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...

Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?
... That's what you told us to say.
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
...hey Chuckie, how's the woman- slayer?
Wanna play some tennis Saturday?
...you take that Anacott Steel?
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan?
Got a little action there, eh buddy?
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...
What brings you out here...
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
Another cup of coffee?
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.
Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me.
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
Nice club, Mr. Gekko...
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
Know the name?
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.
The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
Where is it?
What if I have a previous engagement?
Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
...isn't it perfect!
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
I can't...and I won't.
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
Cards are on the table. What do you think?
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
What's that?
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
Yes, I guess you're right
Your books Master Loftmore
I hope you enjoyed your visit.
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
Come on.
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
Well, it all started when a friend and I
Anyone else not coming?
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
Can this be stopped?
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
Do you have a scarf?
Yes?
I started seeing things.
What?
Why is he worried?
These are good.
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Are you humoring me?
How?
What's happening to me?
Your friend saw them.
No.
What?
Of course.  You must be so proud.
For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
Well maybe your wife...
Oh-kay...
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
Mrs. Frank?
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
You look a little old for a student.
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
Wow.
He was so pissed.
How you holding up?
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
What is it?
Thanks, but I'm fine.
You think he killed her?
Telling you...
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Sit down here.
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
Oh...
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
Does Norman know?
I'm a terrible friend.
Claire?
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
Of what?
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
I just wish you could have heard her.
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
Sorry.  You understand.
Get down!  He'll see.
He killed her.
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
Tonight?
What are you doing?
You're not at the center.
There we go.
I don't need a shrink.
What are you doing out here?
What?
What are you...?  No.
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
I'm sorry...
...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
The...
It's Madison Fra--
It's too rough.
I don't like this, this...
Your wife...
I was there.
It was last year.  We were having troubles.
That's not what I'm sayi--
I tried to break it off!
Claire...
What?
How can you be sure?
I don't believe you.
:Would you stop it!
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
Rowan...
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
Who is this...?
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
I don't want the -
Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
Michael...  Do what you can.
Lasher - bring us through!
Massive subdural hamatoma.  We have to evacuat it - right now.
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
You're very clever, aren't you...?
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
But I could understand. I want to understand!
The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!
I am your son.  I would not wound you. I could not - ever.
Harder...
My jury's still out on that,
What else did you see- Michael...?
It's unbelievable that you can do that.
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
Why don't you let at do that...?
Stop it.
Hello...?
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Ro, how long have we known each other.
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
You did that, didn't you...?
When aid you get home last night...?
I can't.
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?
We'd better get to work on the papers.
Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
OH MY GAWD!
I thought you were someone else
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
This must be one of the old keys -
I lost the touch
What's with all the locks - and hammering
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
Tell me about your wife...
then why did you marry her -
What didn't you like about her?
What's wrong?
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
First finish your tea...
Don't you want me now LESLIE
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
Is LESLIE here?
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...
Sugar?
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
Get them together.
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
And I was wondering.
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
I-I don't have the keys.
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.
Who exactly ARE you?
Can you believe that was me?
So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols.
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.
Are they okay?
You're a peach.
That's a crappy thing to say.
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
And then what?
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
That's probably my office.
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
Tell me more.
Come on.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
That's part of growing up, honey.
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
How you doing, Artie?
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
How soon can we get something?
Merritt, Forensics.
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
Then what?
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
Guess I kind of lost it there.
Will you do me one favor?
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
Yeah.
At that point were you able to fight him off?
Kelly's next, Gloria.
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?
You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
What are you looking at?
Is there some reason why you're here?
Get off my property.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Okay, what's the matter?
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
Don't forget the car wash.
Look, he forgot.  I knew it.
So, where you off to now?
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
Say you love me.
Good thinking.
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
No.
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
Get away from me.
Davy.
I had to go look for this coupon.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Always hoping.  Or this...
Aha!
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
All that jumping and kicking.
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
Well... that, too.
Uh... how long ago was this?
What's this?
And people are actually fooled by that?
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
I know!  I know!
My hat is off to you, sir.
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
You've... done... this... before.
She's perfectly safe.
My.  It's gotten longer.
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
Hey...!
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
Because it's true.
You all right?
What's that?  I hear something!
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
Madmartigan, I need your help.
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
I'll help you...!
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
Did *you* give that acorn its power?
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
Patience, Willow.
I'm not going in there.
Ohhh, I hate this.
Milking?
I've seen pictures.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Where's Timmy and Buck?
Who are these orphans, anyway?
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
Nail it!
Have you got your gun on now?
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
Whacking?
They kid a lot.
But not a good tired.
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.
How long have I been here?
I was being foolish?
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
That's God's way!
I want you to take this... to remember by.
I got there late, John.
You hear me?
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
You admit you're lying?
Did you find him?
Good morning.
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
She say where he is?
What about Carter?
He's not in this building.
He'll live.
Momma... are they angry with us.
Aunt Em!
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
Oh, please give me back my dog!
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
Run, Toto, run!
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
Oh, now?
Are you ready now?
Yes, I'm ready now.
Yes --
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
And him a brain.
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
I'd sooner wait outside.
...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
...free!
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Oil can what?
...along.
Yeah.
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
Here --   Come on.
That's right.
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
No, sir!
Come on -- come on --
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.
Yeah --
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
Well --
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
You new?
The plutonium is missing.  Theyve taken the core!
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
The King pipeline.
What kind of bikes did you ride?
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It wont just be two weeks out of action.
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  Ive known that girl all her life. Im not sure she knows what shes walking into.
You havent been given an assignment in this case.
The report King bought. Its a manual. Renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
Your last chance. Take the money.
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
Shell get over it.
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.
Then take me with you.
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
How did you survive?
...what?
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didnt have to sleep with you to find that out.
Wheres M?
So you killed your father.
Valentin Zukovsky.
See?  Youre upsetting my customers. What do you want?
Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff.
So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people.
What is this place?
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if theyre coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
He was a...good lover?
This is the end.
What about our end?
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
A whore fucking.
The bearer of bad news.
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
Jon, I do not want to hear it.
What -- am I --
Jon -- for Gods sake, what do you see?
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
Im not.
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
His what?
Old?
. . . What?
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
Laurie --
This'd better not be what I think it is.
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
What's he doing?
Dan -- what do we do now?
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
. . . That was quick.
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
Why is that?
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
What do I get out of it?
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
What game is that?
Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
Do you know what a wire transfer is?
What are you?
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
Are you alright?
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
Where's he headed?
Where'd the damn truck go?!
Toadies right behind.
What was that for?
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
Nice hops.
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
What are you talking about?
What's wrong with him?
Are you all right?
I'll tell you one thing though.
Jean... can you?
What do you say?
Let go.
Dr. Grey.
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
The intention of registration act -
What are you going to do?
The point of what?
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
I lost him.
Is it enough?
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
And who might you be?
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
What was your grandfather's name?
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?
Give him an extra dollar.
Carlson!
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
Surprised?
I hope you like large weddings.
Are you suggesting I call him master???
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
You mean... the laboratory??
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
How long will this whole thing take?
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
One week at the most!?
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
But, sir...
And do you also say Fro dereck?
No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
There wolf!  There castle!
The wockers with the knockers.
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
How?
Do you have the name I wrote down?
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
It's always been one of my favorite names.
More, do you hear me?
Throw the third switch!
You'll be getting me sad next.
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
But you did -- I just heard it.
Original.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
No, no!  That whole thing!
Yes, Master!
How's it going?
All right -- where is she?
Get the sedative ready!
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!
Extremely well.
Are you busy?
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
Inga, wake up!
A god?
What are you going to do?
I'd be so nervous.
Look how far we've come.
How do you know they're done?
Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
Will you hear "Last Post", Sir?
Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .
Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
