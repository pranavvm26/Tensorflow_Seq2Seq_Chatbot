Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Let me see what I can do.
That's because it's such a nice one.
Then that's all you had to say.
You always been this selfish?
No...
I hope so.
No.
Who?
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
I don't have to be home 'til two.
Hopefully.
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
You're welcome.
Like you care.
But you hate Joey
You did what?
So did you
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
It's just you.
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
The prom?  Kat has a date?
So they tell me...
How many people go here?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
He seems like he thrives on danger
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
That's what I just said
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Don't make me do it, man
Sure
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
And why would I do that?
How much?
Fifty, and you've got your man.
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
That's never been proven
I didn't have a choice.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Who?
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
I know, just let me sleep
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Busy
Maybe.
BIANCA
Something like that
No one else knows
You know what I mean
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
Don ' t you even dare. . .
I thought you were punishing me.
So what I want doesn't matter?
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Yeah.  I guess.
Right.
We're your guys.
I'm likin' you guys better
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
With the teeth of your zipper?
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
Pirate -- no question.
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
I know.
You don't usually ask.
Appointment to what?
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
Not bad.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
No?
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Chief says...
You did the same to your God!
To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
Colon!  Don't!
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
Surely you can do anything you want.
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
A woman?
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
And what do you think Mendez?
Come over here.
You think I don't know that?
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
You're right.  Let the men decide.
What about Oleg?
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
No.  No way.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
Yes, I considered it.
No.
No.
I know.
They're not gonna send you right back.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
Right.
Pouring it out!
Daphne, I...
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
End my career?
Yeah, right.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
When?
Stay with her.
No.  I'm okay.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
You're Polish?
I'm on duty.
Raw deal.
So am I.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Alright?
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
Tonight.
See you later.  Good luck.
Jesus Christ.
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
You stuff sausage in it.
Get down on your knees.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
I have five-hundred dollars.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Yes.  Both.
Okay.
Okay.
Don't speak Russian!
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
You said speak Czech!
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
Credit?
Did you hurt her?
Ha. Ha.
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
That's what it looks like to me.
No way!  He's mine!
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
She's wonderful.
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
That seems very unlikely.
But not completely inconceivable?
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
No.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
And don't you worry about it.
Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
How many days until you come home?
How is gregor?
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
Certainly.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
Any clue as to what it is?
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
That's true.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
Yeah, I've been busy.
Great, just great.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
You got a real big mouth, convict.
Whaddya mean, buy?
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
You sure that's the reason?
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Luther's on the move...
Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
I didn't have the time.
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
Hey, you know what I really think?
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
That's the way I see it, too.
Jack, are you okay?
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Hiya, kid.
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
So what?
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
Shut up.
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
First, the money.
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
Not bad, not bad.
I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
This ain't a credit business.
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
They are robots!
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
You noticed...
I know. I was there when she arrived.
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
One more reason to shoot first eh?
Thank you, Mr. President.
What is?
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
They are... with me...
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
...'Scuse me?
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Yes ma..
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
Have you pulled yourself together?
Thanks for reminding me..
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
He's on vacation.
I'll be right back.
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
What is it?
I thought you were divorced.
Cornelius..
You know women normally change five times more than men.
OK, you can turn around!
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
...The rain falls...
Because...
Actually only one cell survived..
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Only too well... here you must be parched..
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Yes, Sir!
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
Do you know how much I missed you?
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Honey, I'm not, please...
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
You don't understand...
I just talked to her.
There's nothing harder.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
I'll consider it.
I'd rather you didn't.
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
Right here.
What are you... ?
Look, I don't know what this...
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
I don't know...
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
You enjoy it?
Nobody saw you bring her in?
What did you do with her body?
Stop talking.
I'm listening.
That's right.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
Never mind how I found you.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Fuck you.
You'll get it when we get there.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
I'll risk it.
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
Three, four years.
Child pornography.
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
I'm a working stiff, pops.
See ya.
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
I try to be.
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
Neil... Neil Cole.
I don't know.
We're all like that.
Will you let me look?
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
Who is this... ?
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
No, you may not.
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
What's wrong?
Kristen...
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
Sounds like a game show host to me.
You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
We have matching luggage.
Extra money, huh?
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Three days.
Who?
Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
Alright, I think I see salvation...
Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
You just stay put.  You need rest.
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
It's lonely in there, in my room.
Been having bad dreams.
My friend, with the funny hand.
He's inside you, where he hides.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
You're right.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
Since my little girl became a mom...
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Nobody thinks that.
Then we'll find another way.
You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
Two hours a day, six days a week.
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
Listen!  Hear that?
You know - it <u>is</u>?
We'll have to look for them later.
I...don't know!
Why do you say that?
Under <u>water</u>?
There's got to be an explanation!
Huh?
Take a look.
Come where?
- for horrors like yourself?
Your friend was to remain where he was!
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
I'll be another!
All right - go to it.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Twombley involved?
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
You think so.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
Really.
Yeah.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
How'd you get the job?
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
To us it was.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
See, I knew you'd be mad.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Yes.
It belongs to Pop.
Nothing.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
Could be.
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
For a while.
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
Yeah. I mean that.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
Jack doesn't need money.
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Think they're alright?
There's a furnace.
When did she die?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
His office. You mean my old office.
He got his deer yet?
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
Crawl!
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
Twombley.
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
Who?
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
Want to know what I think happened?
That it wasn't an accident.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
Yes dear?
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
Hey, you guys back already?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Did we warn them off?
Got it.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
To swear you in as President.
Yes, Mr. President.
My loyalty was never to my country.
About goddamn time.
Dead.
Nine.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
We're not going to make it.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Thank you.
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
That was war.
Jim...
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
Good. Good.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
That isn't necessary.
Can't it wait?
White House Situation room.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
But...
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
This is the President.
That's my job.
Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
We're hooked. Hove into position.
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
Commissioner.
Commissioner, Aquarius.
You better check it, Unger.
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Who's that, Ted?
I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Ted!
Not now, Elaine.
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
I mean for Ted.
No, I've been excited before.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
I think so.
Yes, sir.
Scraps.
All right.  Here.
A b...
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
Don't try to stop me!
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
Surely there must be something you can do.
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
Yes. Yes, of course.
A hospital? What is it?
He had fish.
Well...
I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
Ted!
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
I remember everything. All I have are memories.
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Uh-huh.
Yes, Captain?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
I'm Randy.
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Of course.
Would you go up, please?
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean "excrement" and "cranium".
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
And that fits?
Uh, Matthew...
Stay back!  I'm okay.
This is mole.  It's good.
Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
I appreciate your honesty, George.
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
Why?
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
We all did.
No... two.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Ss'kya'ta'.
It is. 
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
I got him.  Don't get pinned.
Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
How long until it blows?
All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
Well, thanks, I --
Hear me out...
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
Bullshit!
Sorry to disappoint you.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
It's insured.
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
Alive?
Do it!
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Let's waste him.  No offense.
Stand back.
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
No.  Have you?
Hudson, give us a break.
You're just reading me.
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
And hope to die?
You're really something, ace.
Did one of those things grow inside her?
Wah...?  Where are...?
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
Sir -
Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
Em iram! Em iram!
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Why?
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
Not at all.
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Gertrude!
You do me too much honour, Sire.
Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
Yes?
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
Enchanted, Madame.
How is your financial situation?
How many pupils do you have?
It's a secret.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
This is just a game, Papa.
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
Papa!
I will, sir.
Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
Yes what?
In there, sir.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Well, we can.
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
Did you like it, then?
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
Whom did they choose?
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
Who are you?
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
No! No, it's him!
Finish what?
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Consigned to flames of woe.
So now - A minor. Suddenly.
Please! Just one moment.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
Also identical?
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
On the contrary.
A little modesty would suit you better.
May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
And do they believe it?
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
What difference does that make?
I can't wait.
Who is she?
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Dr. Hirsch?
Yes, Doctor?
Yes, sir.
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
Is David acting strangely?
No, a cab will be faster.
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
I would think so.
Lovely.
It's nice to see you.
Yes?
Of course.
I was awake and he was in my room.
Yeah, I do, but go to work.
Okay.
I'm freezing.
Don't you remember?
David, don't lose control.
No.
No!
No.
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
Oh, come on, tell us.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
I don't know.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Wrong.
You ask them.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Come on, I'm freezing.
I have no idea.
I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
It's circling us.
Do you think it's a dog?
No.
Yeah.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
Nurse!
Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
Hi, David.
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
He's on the telephone.
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
I'd like some tea, please.
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
How much?
It was more than that last week.
Here's twenty-five thousand.
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
What about?
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
That's very simple. I was home.
You understand?
They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
I want to be near you!
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer
A misunderstood bachelor.
Yes, sir.
John, how's your wife this morning?
Well . . .
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Yes, sir.
Where is he now?
Numbers? No, never mind.
No, sir.
All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.
But I haven't . . .
Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Mine too?
Is it safe?
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
With what?
A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Yeah, swell.
Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that
Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
Are you sure?
Huh?
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
Yes.
I'm okay, Matt.
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Jim Younger, I told you--
Sometimes a wound will kill.
You stay out of this, Bob.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
Nope.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
She got two of them.
Yeah.
Sure, cousin.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
Missed you too, cousin.
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
I'm thinking...
Shakespeare.  He's European.
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
The District Marshall
Ho-yah!
You're right, sir.
Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
I think he's already feeling better.
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
Heard of him.
What do you think?
Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
Don't care.
Bob's upset.
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
Yeah.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
Yeah, Jimmy?
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
Boys?
You were little Jesse James when you left.
If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
No! I mean, of course not. No.
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
A river pirate.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
"Hmm" what?
Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
Yes ma'am.
But I like the presidential suite.
Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
I just though you were awful cute.
Lyla Devereux.
That is so gentlemanly of you.
Really?
I'm doing you folks a favor --
It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
THEN WHO DID?!
I look forward to seeing it.
What, sir?
I remember you.
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
It is a nice piece of writing.
Vengeance.
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Is it a what?
Yes?
You just haven't been looking.
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
Alright.
Evelyn?
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
Everybody's rich.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
What are the rules for a sweater vest?
I know her. I knew her.
How did you guess?
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
I won't...don't worry.
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
It's just not.
Commes des Garcon.
It looks that way, doesn't it?
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Leaving what?
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
Yes, Patrick?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
No, not really.
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
That's...that's too bad.
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
Paul Owen.
No.
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
No. I'm okay.
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Who do you ask?
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
Well, maybe he did, huh?
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
Wait. That's not what I've got.
That's not the information I've received.
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
Not in the mood, I guess.
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
But Marcus denied it?
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
Where was Marcus?
I'm so hungry.
I'm hungry
Al.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
It's...it's...all right.
Cecelia is, well...you know 
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
What?
Milo, you --
You're just afraid to eat it.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
Wanna be a part of history?
Gimme the coordinates?
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
We tried!
He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.
Skywire.
...Do I?
Oh. Yeah.
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
The wrong place?
Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.
I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
You do?
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
Where we going?
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Why's that?
Why would you do a thing like --
Oh yeah?
They'd frame him.
They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
Certainly not at my happy home.
But they'd still get the idea, right?
Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
Gary.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
It's three years old, it --
Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
What?!
You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
Where is he?
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
You may.
Sak-i it to me!
Be careful.
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Yes?
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
What's the other?
What?
Yes Basil?
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
I'm sure.
Here, use mine.
How do you know?
He's too well-protected right now.
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
I couldn't have another bite.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
Of course, luv.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
Do you think she's prettier than I?
I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
Indeed.
Likewise.
Danger's my middle name.
Sure.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
Blow me.
Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
No need. I'll call again.
... bottle ...
Love...
... love...
Three days.
Ropes?
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
Next assignment?
Too many cooks --
'Our revels now are ended.'
Valentine, listen to me ...
You're mad.
What are my choices?
I'll never marry you.
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Rules are made to be broken.
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
Thank you, Trubshaw ...
For a man in my position --
An eccentric recluse?
How on earth can you tell?
Very good, Steed ...
Is that written in his shoe?
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
But if someone miniaturized the process...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Mrs. Peel ... ?
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
No trouble.
Always.  Except ...
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
Have we been invited?
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
You first.
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
But --
If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
Getting to what?
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
I was at Harrow ...
Ugh ...
Debbie's marrying Rick.
Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em. 
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
Women!
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
Not interested.
What is this person's story here?
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
The best.
The car for Debbie?
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
Yes, sir.
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
It looks awful.
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
C'mere.
You better not have too much joy.
Gonna get married...
Yeah.
Ilene, Rick promised...
I know what I'm doing... Go!
I hope those guys are all right.
I think I screwed that one once.
What are you...
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
That's more like it.
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
Yes.
I want women.
I'll take some.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
What do you mean, it changes?
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
It's Bullwinkle.
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
Rick!
No. Let's at least finish the set.
In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
The phone made me do it!
No, Brett, I...
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
I'm separated.
Of course.
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
Got me.
Still drawing a blank.
Very.
Who's your friend?
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
I'm saved. Let's party!
You got it.
I don't know.
There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
Just come down, John. Just --
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
-- Never mind.
Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
Thanks for the insight.
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
What are we going to do about this?
Jennifer.
You look great.
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Really? No kidding.
Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
How's it going?
Well, you did invite me here.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Then why did you quit?
Uh huh.
-- I work for the city.
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
I don't have a story.
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
No it couldn't.
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
How ya feeling?
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
Nice boat.
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
Coffee sucked.
Cute.
I'm busy.
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
What do you listen to, Stephen?
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
Nah...
I was gonna bring it back myself.
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
I forgive you.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
What case?
Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.
B-L-A-K it is.
I'm on it.
...that simpleton is holding back the race.  They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
Ho!
Louder.  They can't hear you.
BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout.
What do I do?
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
Meaning?
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
How much?
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
Did we get our bill yet?
And I'm the feet.
Why?
How you sound?
No costume.  No blackface.
Go on.  Good so far.
What are there character traits?
Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
Where do you go from here?
He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
Manray!
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
Everybody shut up.
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
I don't want to hear it.
He's just playing big brother.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
Give me the gun.
Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
I don't believe it.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
I'll be right over.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
Not at all?
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
You've never had any formal training, either?
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
What do you mean?
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
...the big apple, New York, New York.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
You tellin' the truth.
Oh her.
I thought you got rid of...
A song a comin' I feel.
Enough.
Are you trying to rap to me?
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
My people love me.
Just ask me what you want to know.
Say what, Manray?
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
And his baggage?
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
Your cousins go out with him.
We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess."
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
The coward!
I will let down the steps for your honor.
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
As much as possible.
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
Yes!
You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
It's ten thirty in the morning.
Who?
Fine.
None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
We don't know. West is dead.
We found him like this...
Shut up.  West's dead.
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
I asked for a policeman.
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
I didn't shoot West --
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
How do you know that?
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
I...
I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
I didn't kill him --
Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
No. I said Dunbar.
Maybe --
Maybe he...
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
The Senator...
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
You're drunk --
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Yes.
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
Best time for banal chit-chat.
I lost a bet.
Watch me.
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
What?
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
You couldn't have known --
You wanted to get the truth.
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
Get in.
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
No death certificates. No crime.
Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
Really.
Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
Oh, you remember now --
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
He whispered it in my ear.
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
Yeah.
No --
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
Yes!
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
There's only one I want.
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
Don.
Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
Was she nekkid?
It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
No, I understand.
I never knew.
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
What's your name, Giant?
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
You mean, while I'm here.
I will.
I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
Can we talk?
The river?
Like this.
You say...
Yes. Exactly.
Go out with me.
Really.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
I'll help you.
I need to lie down for a bit.
You don't have to.
He's up with your father.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
Really! That's wonderful.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
We'll stop then.
Yeah.
What are you doing here?
Leave him!
Ch...
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
What are you doing here?
And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
No. It is too judgmental.
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
Good night.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
So you're just going to be vindictive
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
Have you got your passport?
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
No. But you tend to tie them up.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
Sometimes.
Sometimes neither.
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
Get out
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
No.
What?
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
Laugh it up.
I'm trying to quit.
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
I'm sorry.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
Oh, she older than that.
Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
That'd be nice.
You gonna sing me somethin'?
I need ya help again.
Yeah.
That's not right, really, cuz I...
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
Stop what?
I got others.
Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
Let go...
Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
Come on, gal...
Well I don't...
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
The fuck you been doin' to me?
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
What do you want?
In my house, you watch that lip...
You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
Or what?
Whose doin' is that?
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
I don't fuckin' cook.
We drinkin' buddies now?
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
By myself?
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
Now, hold up.
Like I told you.
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
Ask the chef.
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
Why she got a chain on her?
You could put it that way.
Rae don't do this now...
Rae!
Yeah?
Holy shit!
You need money again?
All that shit's on aisle 5.
The hell are you talkin' about?
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
The hell you call me?
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
Let go...
-- I should tear your head off.
Beats forty hours on a plane.
Where is the subway station, please.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
I didn't know.
You said that in the last two places.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Connie...
Where would you look for the mafia?
Give us a break...
Why weren't you at the platform?
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
Sure.
If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
No.
Kampai.
A wife.  She left.
Luck.
He's on duty.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
What do you chant?
Why would you care?
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
I'm taking you back.
Save it, I already took the tour.
Guess I'm on a roll.
He killed a police officer.
Right.
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
You certainly have a nice place here.
If he won't cooperate?
Where?
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
Death.
Nexus - 6.
Dr. Tyrell?
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
His company made us.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.
Do you have something against science?
Nexus designated Zhora:  incept June 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.
Prosit.
I'm doing okay.
Yes?
What night?
I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
For holes.
Why should I be?
You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
Can you?  I couldn't.
What do you want me to do?
Me and my dad.
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
What?
Hmmm?
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
What?
Black?
If she is, the machine works.
Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.
Sorry.
But how come I'd be there?
A tortoise.  What's that?
I never seen a turtle.
Hi.
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
What's that?
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
Oh, brother...
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
I just had a mental picture of...
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
What's the pay?
Sure.
My Mom and Dad.
What?
Okay.
What for?
The big one!
Everybody's divorced.
The engine is still running.
Sure.
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
Uh...yeah.
So, what are you seeing?
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
No way.
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
Well, you had better!!
Thanks.
Sing it to me.
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
Blow out the candles!
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
And it's called...?
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
1959.
I'm not wearing his pants.
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
The sky!!!
Up there!!
Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
Hi.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
I just hope this is still good up there.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
What?
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
You bet, hon!
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
Would you like a tranquilizer?
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
What shall we call him?
And I made these!
Well, we did in my family!
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Would you excuse me?
Just open the door.
We do?
--and we will--
Amen.
To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
Some time.
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
He's from Alaska.
Eve?!
We did not leave together.
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
You're goddamn right I am!
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Fallout shelter.
Give it back to him.
We'll find him.
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Okay.
The criminals are winning.
Yes.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Yes sir. I sure am.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Never before this.
See my nipples?
Yes, I like you.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Please, please stay.
Frank is coming?
Whatiya mean?
Does that scare you?
No, it's not Don.
I want you to stay with me.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
If you want to.
What?
Okay Frank.
Be right down.
Alright.
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Uh-uh.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Oh, okay, can I call?
Okay, okay. Bye.
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Goodnight.
Yeah.
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Okay.
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Go find one.
What?
Let's do him right here.
Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
What?  What, that guy?
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
Shut it. It's Ma.
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
Italian.
...so that which is good may flourish
What?
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Yes.
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
It is your corrupt we claim.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
Rule of thumb?
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
How do you figure?
Rocco!
Where's my cat?
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
What?
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Eight.
Who were the victims?
I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
I'll be back at 9:00.
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
How long since your last confession, my son?
The... The funny man.
He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
Right. The blond guy.
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
We know there's another stocker.
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Look at the treads on those.
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
Where was it parked?
Maybe he just went to the store.
We said 48 hours.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
You don't know how to hotwire.
She needed it.
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
Ah. Couple days ago.
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
Who's Mr. Henry?
Let me feel that.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
Eleven fifteen.
Did that hurt?
Let's go. Come on.
I'll get him.
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
Yeah.
Pretty much everything.
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
He stole a tractor.
Nice to meet you.
It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
I don't want to die.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Death.
But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
Let them fight.
No, I don't mind.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Sure.
No.
Who's got the car keys?
Dies y nueve.
I hear you're a good thief.
Is that Buckethead?
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
True.
You're the faggot.
Not even for emergencies?
It's true, Dignan.
I'll just drive my car.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
I told you he's crazy.
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
Don't count it.
No. I was calm.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
I'm going back.
Don't threaten me, Bob.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
What's his name?
Anthony. Bad news.
Not bad.
Man, I don't want to go into this.
That's OK.
Where's Applejack?
No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
26 weeks.
Did you hear that?
No, my friend knows her.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
You Hoto?
Mr. Henry?
Anything else?
What do you mean?
Never heard of it.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
'Why' would be enough for me.
Keep going...
You killed them.
You're a liar.
I can't let you do that either.
Is this really happening?
Felt a little light.
I don't know.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
I don't know! Why would I lie?
-- take the back -- get another car --
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
I should be better by now.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
What?
-- where? -
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
Bourne?
I want someone I know to take me in.
There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
Careful...
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
Here?
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
That's where we came out.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
Me? Four years.
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
Am I a doctor, no, but...
If you say so.
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
So let the council swear publicly.
He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.
Fourteen? --
I rest.
Aye, we'll get 'em.
You win.
I will not.
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
No. He did not.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
...Tonight!
...I wouldn't know.
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
I am trying.
They've tricked us.
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
And the bad news?
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
Something must've happened! What set him off?
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
How long will I be in here?
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
No, protecting her.
But I... I need those books.
What?
You really don't remember anything that happened?
Damn. Your dad did this?
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
Go on. Sit down.
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
What do you mean?
Different? How?
Yeah?
Know what?
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
...yes.
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
Who's to say you can't make things better?
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
Deal. Now read me something.
It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
What's wrong with you?!
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
I thought I was the bad guy!
I'm sorry.
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
What is your name?
As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
I won't.
Er, good luck, yes.
Er, my check, please.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
Practically no one.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
You needn't be concerned about me.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
Has it got a wow finish?
It doesn't matter.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
Yes, ma'am.
Won't you join us?
Be careful.
Apparently he has the letters.
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
-- Yes?
Of course, I'll be careful.
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
Thank you. I try.
Not at all.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
Yes, I get the point.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
Here it is.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
We'll be there.
I slept very well.
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
I expected no less, Captain.
Perhaps.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
A leader, like Laszlo?
I see what you mean.
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
Huh!
Perhaps not.
Yeah? Have a brandy?
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
Yeah? What's his name?
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
He'll take one.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
-- Hello, Ilsa.
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Oh, he won't be followed here.
Take your hands off me!
What is your nationality?
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
-- You thought what?
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
I like it fine here.
Yeah?
Not right now.
No.
Shut up and go home, will you?
Yes, boss.
You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
Take it, damn it.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
Fix raft first.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
You are.
Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.
No.
He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
Well, not really, I --
I've got lots of time.
Cold.
I thought I did.
You don't seem too happy about it.
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
You want to.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
I thought you might have.
That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.
Yeah?
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
Not when you have no choice.
It means a lot...that you came.
You too.
And how was your Christmas?
Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
Let's eat.
I'm doing fine.
There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
It was fifteen minutes late.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
To Wilson.
To life.
Believe me I know.
What?
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
No sweat.
San Francisco.  And you?
It claims to restore monthly regularity.
You weren't dreaming about me.
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
I doubt it. She's just an...
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
Okay...
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
He's *paralyzed*!
No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
Yes, I *have*!
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
Someone not from Maine.
Is that soon?
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
A B-24 Liberator.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Oh, I would love that, Wally.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
Is it true?
You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
Obviously.
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
Of course.
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
We heard that one already, Homer.
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
Now, now. He's a good boy.
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
When will he be home, Major?
It look nicer then home!
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
Tough day?
That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
Everything looks in order.
No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
Isn't it always?
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
After you cut her loose.
Guess so.
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
We're going to give him the money back?
Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
Let's go, Jake?
I told you, use less powder.
I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
She's up for it.
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
You sure?
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
No. Just confidence.
You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?
No thanks. I'm good.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Very much so.
Sure.
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
Just play a part. A little acting.
Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Intuition.
Don't ruin this for me.
You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
What do you want? An apology?
You better get over to Al's. Now.
Miles...
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
Good point.
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
You sure?
But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
Escorts!
With identification.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.
Keep it up.
That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different.
Eee Oott Auught!
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
In over your head?
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
What do you get out of it?
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
No. Thanks.
It's the tension.
I can imagine.
Not entirely.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
I've got a job.
How did you land that?
It's the truth.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
Leave it.
You will?
You were talking in your sleep.
Gambling's not about money.
Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
I hate public transport.
I want to buy a car.
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
Don't let yourself down.
Then you're not a pro.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
Yes.
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
Do you?
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
You did?
Have I?
And what do you do, Lucy?
Are you going to put a spell on me?
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
That bitch? No.
No thanks.
Rough life, Jack.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
We check every four days.
We do. 
I don't think so.
Five.
Five.
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
How?
Fine.
I can see.
Oh. What's wrong now?
Eventual supernova.
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
I read the same here.
Check at six minutes.
Energy shielding positive function.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
Right!
All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
Of course not.
I'll check it.
Yes, Doolittle.
Doolittle...
What?
Who cares?
Oh, sure.
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Phenomenology...
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
That's not why we're here.
You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
How come I never hearda you before?
What the hell are you doing?
None of your business.
Leave.  Now.
No.
Where?
Justine was not an unwilling participant.
Don't look down.
Later.
It's a rule.
Am I?
Yech...
Can you help me get her back?
Hello...
But why can't we stay here?
Are we in some kind of trouble?
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
Mommy, where are you?
Logan Cale.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
The one you're wearing?
Wasn't that hard.
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
Lauren's not my wife.
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
I won't be staying.
It was open.
You need to get out more.
You did go through my stuff.
The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
How much do you know?
The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
I don't know what to say.
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
Ladies would be elsewhere.
I'll wait.
A friend of your fiance's.
Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
You did.
I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
I actually know how this works.
What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
Pull the cash.
I have sincere eyes.
You're the best, Maxie.
What if he's on the level?
Later.
Max--
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
You don't.
How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
Thanks.
It's okay.
What? That's disgusting!
YO, DOOFUS!
Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
Tickets?
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
They're what?
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
What?
If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
We won?!
Let's lift up her shirt.
I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
The KISS Army!
Not if I shoot first!
Neither do I!
Good MORNING!
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
So... that's it?
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
Hey...
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
Why is that?
I'm sorry.
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
Why?
I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
With, like, images?
Maybe she's asleep.
Hey. You OK?
It's safe here.
Who's Frank?
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
That is a terrible nickname.
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
I know, Dad.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
Frank.
I think about girls a lot.
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
God exists because you're horny.
Where are we going?
I have the power to build a time machine.
Frank is going to kill.
You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
You're not a bitch.
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
Kitty...
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
She's alive, sweetie.
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
Airport Ho-Jo!
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
We all do. Now let's go.
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
I just did.
Here, have some.
Yes...
Hi.
So? Be real easy.
She's the winner and we're going to state.
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
Ohio...
All right, then.
The important thing is that we have a winner...
Tammy Curry?
I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Enid ate a whole pan!
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
The king can do to wrong! 
"My dear"...
"My dear President"...
But you're my father -
Take a letter...
What's the matter with you?
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
Then you don't wanna work hard?
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. 
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? 
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
You swine!
I still like UPSTART the best.
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
Two, please.
No, I think a whiskey.
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
And here are my mother and father.
Hmmm?
I'll show you! I'll show you!
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
All you do is profit from another man's misery!
Right... Right.
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
I feel much better. Thank you.
I am very pleased to meet you.
Three quarters of an hour.
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
I knew you'd understand. Here.
Oh no?
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
The main spire.
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Say "Merrick".
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
Righteousness...
You did not ask me.
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
Yes.
I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
Yes, John?
Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
Yes, John.
Yes.
There is one more thing, John. Here.
Fine.
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
Ah! It's my father!
You're losing your temper!
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
I've never been to bed with anybody!
And I thought you said it was something special...
And the week before that?
Who?
Of course.
I... but I...
We blew the Horn Resounding.
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
Yes?
Why?
I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
Yes... oh, yes...
The important thing is not to panic.
Yes.
What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
Very deep... usually...
No.
You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
Don't you FEEL it?
Sorry.
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
What "magic"?
Look out!
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
Well, come on!
Oh... I feel a little... oh...
What is it?
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
Please.
No, I'm not.
That's it!
Hang on...
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
Help!
Help!
But it's a responsibility...
Not now, Sven...
Stop it!
DEATH TO DRAGONS!
Easy, Dad!
Dad!
You liar!
I'm not frightened... of anything...
I did. You said, things were fine.
No one.
You did? You liked me?
In the room?
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
I'm not nuts.
Yeah?
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
You know Wilmont?
Wilmont. Near the high school.
It's okay. I didn't think you were.
What?
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah.
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
No, not at all.
Oh, yeah.
I think so.
Okay.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
No, it isn't that.
No.
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
Egad, were you horrified?
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
Come up and see me... now.
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
Is that what you want?
Okay.
Hi.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
Yeah, like that.
I know.
yeah?
Um, no.
Female.
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
I think we should go.
Tomorrow?
Make love?
I'm nervous, too.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
Guess what I'm wearing.
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
That's your look for me.
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
Hi.
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
Very cool. Trippy.
Hi.
I better do this, Stan.
You found us okay?
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
How did I look?
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
Can I... I brought some --
Then why did you ask me?
Yes?
No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
That's fine, Stan.
Maybe after the holidays then.
Just wanted to let you know.
This one's history. Moving on...
It's a quote book.
Easy come, easy go.
I'm staying with the Countess.
I don't.
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
American Cheese. The king of road food.
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
Tired...
Your ranch?
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared.
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
We'll make it.
You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
Starck!
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
Starck, you still showing those readings?
What you got, Peters?
...you okay?
Justin.
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
Yes...
Better if I just show you.
I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
Come again, Skipper?
No, no, we just got her back together...
Keep your eyes open.
But you can breathe it.
What about the life readings you picked up?
What's causing the readings?
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
What's going on in there, Starck?
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
Can you shut it down?
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
Range 3000 meters and closing.
Get them back --
I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
How?
I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
The forward airlock.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
Oh, he did.
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
Victor must've taken him.
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
Not this again --
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Ben, are you there?
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
Johnny.
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Dude. That's my sister.
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Never better.
Yes, thanks.
What? What do you mean you --
I think it was a little more complicated than --
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
You need a doctor.
Hilarious.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
Reed, we're running out of time.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
Of course.
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
It's the first door on your left!
Later.
This is how I dress all the time.
I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
Don't strain yourself.
They're not home yet.
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
Why?
I didn't say that.
Yes, sir.
Ugh.
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Nice to meet you.
Get a ride with somebody.
What a guy.
Come on...
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
Damone. It's Mark.
So what makes you so sensitive?
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
Then don't hassle it.
Naw. Any good?
This ain't no cop.
They're fuckin' with us.
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
What should I do?
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
No way! He just called him a dick.
It was okay.
Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
I think they're both virgins.
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
What?
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
He's not coming.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
What class?
Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
I don't know. Wherever you want.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
We keep them, in case the people come back.
Oh... yes.
Yeah. It's my sister's.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
I've heard that, too.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
Crying? Why was she crying?
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
Dobermans don't talk.
You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
What?
Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
Lacerda?
But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
Not yet. I want to study its habits.
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
Why what?
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
...and every one of them stacked naked...
They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.
No! I swear I'm not!
Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
Spare me.
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
Where is everyone?
I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
C'mon guys--
OPEN THE DOOR!
And the head?
Hey!
Easy.
There's a tunnel.
Shit!
No. You?
The door... on three.
Just an observation.
Well then I guess we should just give up.
My truck.
We lived near power lines.
We gotta try.
What?
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
But --
Okay then.
Sure.
What?
He only shot you once.
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
What?
Nothing.
Fully.
Two.
Covered.
Seven.
Oh? And what's that?
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
No bullshit.
HELLLLLLLLP!!
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
HELLLPPP!
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
She's not very nice, is she?
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
I'm not lying.
I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
I'd like nothing better.
My clothes?
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
Oh well. I guess I better leave then.
Frances.
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
An actress.
Right now we have to be practical.
He knows, Frances.
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
All square, Doc.
I know you believe that.
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
But I'll never win that.
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.
I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
Are you an actor?
Then don't go to Hollywood.
...Not if I can help it.
They'll mend.
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
Not me. But other people seem to.
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
Enh.
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
Yeah.
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
The hell you will, Harry York.
I know.
No. To thoroughbreds.
Who?
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
'Golden Boy.'
I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
Your big speech?
I already have.
The speech? Real good.
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
Go on...
What's wrong?
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
Excuse me.
Don't I know you?
Stay calm, please.
I'll have someone show you to your room.
You didn't say 'Symington says'.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
No! No!
You're kidding.
What?
You drove him to his torment.
People can be kinder than you think.
Kill me and have done with it.
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
It's been months. It's not like him.
He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
I'm all right. I'm safe,
Now husband and wife.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
Very well then.
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
Can you think of a better reason?
It's a letter to my father.
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
No. They don't.
I didn't find what I was looking for.
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
Are you a physician?
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
Un-hunh.
You're right. It makes no sense.
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
Good point.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
I'll go take a look.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...
I meant everything.
Don't get up. Take a second...
Where's Ned?
Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
So let's do it.
I'm exhausted.
I have no idea.
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
He's my son.
Come again?
Sorry, I need everybody.
That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
My wife.
Yes, she is.
Real McCoy.
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
Forever together.
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
Yes.
-- you got your shower --
What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
She's in the other room.
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
I did?
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
Where are you right now?
Thank you, ensign.
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
Your prerogative, Senator.
Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
So I'll get a fair shot?
"We'll all have lunch."  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!
I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
I'm not sure what --
Motherachrist...
Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is.
Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
California.
If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.
Doesn't matter who she picks.  No woman is going to last one week in a commando training course.  And I don't care who it is.
It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
'Snot me.  It's him.
Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
Just like you would be.
I take it you don't either.  Feet.
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
I saw an article...
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
What about him.
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
Yeah.  Me too.
Thanks, Wick.
When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
He was married?
You got anybody, Wick?
I think you look beautiful.
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
That's not right.
15, sir.
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
Your new roommate.
Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
The first female President?
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
We know, Audrey.
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
But we can get to the west side faster.
It's good to see you, Nick.
I got pretty close.
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
Nesting?
Oh my God! They're coming!
That's the problem. He did.
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
This is not the place...
It's your choice.
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
Oh, I'm not married.
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Where's Luc and Pierre?
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
You're standing on it.
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
You don't have the authority to do that.
Why do you need that?
You were right.
I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
Open.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...
I won't and nothing you say-
Like YOU know?
You go first! There's no time!
Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
I played Richard III...
Shut up.
You could order something in.
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
All this from watching the.. historical records?
FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
Down there.
What?
By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159	NT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT	159
It's okay. Listen-
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
Okay, that's where you want to be.
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
Up.
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
Hey, YOU want to drive?
Where'd they go? Back inside?
We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
Only answers to me.
Tell them? About...
It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
I don't think that's a cloud...
Computer, can it be repaired?
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
Right.
Because it was on the show!
Almost as much as he loves himself.
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
I see them!  I see them! RD STREET	PASADENA 57
Gwen. The show. There's no choice. Do it.
Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
And determination.
Wh... Where are we?
Why don't you just turn it on and see?
It's as far as it goes!
What kind of signal?
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
What does she see in them?
But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?
Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!
There, then, you can have sort of a normal life.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
Yes, general.
No.  I guess.
I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
Then use rocks!
Delighted, sir.
But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
Is this a coup?  Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree?
Yes, I believe so.
I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men...
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.
What else?  From Virginia?
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.
I'd throw everything away for you.
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
Those people?  I doubt they'd think of this.  Ooo, you're wonderful this color!
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
Just because they are born?
Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
So you didn't have the key with you.
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
Who?
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
Okay. So who are you?
Who?
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.
That's right.
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
Harry, lemme give you some advice.
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
Fuckin' basketball game.
I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.
Once.
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
"Mr. Lovejoy".
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
You're kidding, right?
I found him.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
He died.
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
Like this?
Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
Buddy?
That's not bad. I think you got it down.
Who told you that?
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
You broke in?
How much is the wife offered?
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
...That's what we finally decided.
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" - which by the way was a better book than a movie - did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
Man, can you scream.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
Depends, who pays?
Hey, Chili? Look at me.
You bet.
Go get your stuff.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey -  This your ride, Chili?
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
With that coxswain dickhead.
Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
I don't know. Tuesday?
What?
No.
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
Seen a lota movies.
A what?
Then what the hell happened to him?
How long to fix?
She take a radio?
What, you think there's something funny about it?
Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
Right.
I don't know what you're talking about?
You smashed it!
Conveniently enough for you.
You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
Then you're a lucky man.
Right.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
You're a pal.
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
You're more practical than superstitious.
Yup.
But, who -- ?
But where's the damage?
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
What's that supposed to mean?
Epps, over.
Right here.
Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.
If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
Fine with me.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
YES.
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
I just buzzed him in.
Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
What do you mean?
Huh?
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
You can count on me, sir!
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
Jesus...
It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
Why?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
You loser.
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
How perfect.
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
Or maybe not.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
It's still twenty-five minutes early.
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
I dunno...
Come on, it's too late now...
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
Somewhere downtown.
What are you talking about?
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
JOSH!
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
He does that every single day.
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
...maybe we should be lesbos...
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
Don't worry.
Go ahead...
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
What thing?
So should I come over?
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
Maybe an orange juice.
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
That's okay...
I thought it wasn't for sale.
Where did you get those pants?
Norman.
Hey, where are you going?
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
Well why do I care about that?
I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
Watch my stuff.
Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...
Good luck...
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
I really didn't get a good look at her.
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
C'mon, Seymour, please?
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
I'm not holding my breath in that department.
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
That's the spirit!
Really?
Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...
Hi, it's me...
What? You're kidding me...
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
YAAA!
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
...I better not...
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
What?
What do you want?
I-I-I...
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
She's not at home?
Why? What did she tell you?
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
You never had it.
It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
That's very considerate.
I can try.
Has it ever done that before?
But of course yours worked.
Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit- 
Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
Do you ever see him?
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Didn't I do it?
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
I don't know what to do anymore.
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
Now you're talking.
Ghostbusters.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
I don't think we should leave her alone.
How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
My pleasure.
The Upper West Side.
Command me, lord.
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
Maybe they just want to appeal.
You've got to stop them.  Please!
You were the one who got me in.
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
You need the exercise.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
Do it!  Just do it!
I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
And it's all flowing toward the museum.
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.
The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
Huh?  What?
Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
And decent.
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Hi, Louis.
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
That's a violin concerto.
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
Goodbye.
I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
Really!  Is it gone?
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
I don't believe in luck.
Are you Peter Venkman?
No, you may not.
The magic word is "please."
Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
A square?
Close -- but definitely wrong.
Two wavy lines?
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
What?
Why not?
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
Oh, shit!
Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.
Life is just a state of mind.
I blame myself.
God, it's ugly!
And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
What do we do now?
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
LATER, MAN!!
What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
They won't break this one.
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
Yes, Caesar.
The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
God of passages and changes?
Yes!  The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over -- thanks to your father!  Now report to the Senate, Master Galen:  what is Marcus' state?
You're hearing about somebody else.
Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
He killed his father and then my family...
He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.
My troops don't make policy.
It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
Let him trust Quintus.
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
Hello.
Yes.
Yes.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
No, I couldn't.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
Wait a minute.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
Of course not.
Yes.
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Oh my God --
Get out of here.
What do you think?
Did you say rape her?
You've got to tell me what she said.
If you want.
My belt.
I don't know.
I don't understand.
What?
I don't know.
I might.
Yes.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
I have to go back now.
Yes.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Is the doctor anywhere?
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
Who screamed?
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
You heard me. Out of here.
I want you out of here.
I am going to call the police now.
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
I'm in the bathroom.
Will you bring it in to me?
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
What?
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
I'm very neurotic.
Pardon?
Like what?
Well I don't know.
It's all right.
I know that. But I'm --
Right.
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Where is it?
Let me out!
Waiter!
Well -- do you want to go up first?
Yes.
Benjamin.
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Who said it was my first time?
Wait a minute.
If you want.
Are you tired of it?
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
What one.
He's asleep.
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
We don't.
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Think real hard, Benjamin.
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Not particularly.
Art.
I don't think we were the first.
But why shouldn't I?
Now don't start this.
Of course you did.
May I stay then?
Goodnight, sir.
I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
What?
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
But I don't want you to make up something.
We haven't.
-- worried?
To be what?
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
That has nothing to do with it --
Swell. I appreciate it.
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
I'd like to hear it.
Oh no.
Mr. Robinson?
No, it's not --
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
Why?
It's Benjamin.
Benjamin Braddock.
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I -- 
Splendid!
The pearls are in her room.
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
No.
Why?
With the pearls?
How?
You might find a bullet through that head...
Oh -- work!!
Where downstairs?
You're very funny --
Of course.
I feel sorry for him.
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
Yes --
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
How tired you are!
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
Am I quite strange to you?
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear -- 
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
Oh -- 
I know.
I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
For Vienna?
Oh -- yes but -- later.
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
No?
Why do you think --
Don't.
Not at all, sir. 
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
Yes, quite.
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
We could come to my room.
No -- not at all.
No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, Baron.
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
The Grand Hotel.
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Yes --
Moreover...
I got ten marks for that.
That's from skiing.
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Well?
Well?
A thousand marks -- 
Oh, yes.
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
He likes to play the great man.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!
All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
What -- what is it? Last night...
Good morning, Gru -- your --
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
-- We must do something...
I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
You are late. Hurry.
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
Well -- gentlemen.
You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
That.
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
My son --
My son was in the hospital --
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
I will. So long, Bobo.
Roy? He's always crying.
I like you, too.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Fine.
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
I know.
Why? What's wrong?
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
It's not your fault.
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
Perk.
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
Get off the grift, Roy.
No. That was the point.
No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
I've really got to --
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
This way's perfect.
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
I know you do, so that's why --
Uh-huh.
I don't see why not.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.
Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?
That's just Lilly's way.
You ain't seen nothin.
See you soon.
I'll sign that affidavit.
Oh, come on, Roy.
Myra, I'm not following this.
The long end. Big con.
I thought these people were broke.
Yeah? How?
Open it and find out.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
I saw her.
) What?
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
You up to it now?
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
Girl scouts.
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
Care to join me?
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
I think someone broke into my house.
No.
Yes.
Get on the bus.
Just get on the bus.
That would work.
You stole it?
Why not?
Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
It's always John.
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
You're right.  It does sound strange.
I can't believe this is happening.
Are you going to leave, too?
Oh, right.  Sorry.
Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
Can't you hold it?
He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
Why?  You interested?
The voice man!  He's here!
He says things.  Bad things.
I promise.
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
It's a sign.  He's come home.
An old friend.
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
This is madness, Wynn.
Stay away, Sam.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night --
It's a bitch.
Didn't recognize you.
I'm gonna wet my pants.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
Oh, shit.
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
So long, Colonel.
Go home!
I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
How do you know that?
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
I dunno.
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
I dunno.
What's this?
How are you, honeybunch?
You've come to the right man.
I forget mine for years on end.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
I just want one true adventure before I die.
Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!
As a matter of fact--I am home.
Hello.
Are you--do you--
Dr. Woodly.
Is anybody besides you here now?
I'll see.
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
He worships Father.
She has a master's degree in English literature.
He insults him all the time.
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
They're not engaged.
I can't take my eyes off you.
Penelope!
Scat!
Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
Make it fast.
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
Leave a tip.
Nothing.
No.
I don't want to fight you.
Heaven.
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
Situation.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
I did?
A trip, you mean?
Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
Yes.
No you're not!
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
It's a big and busy funeral home.
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
Almost a Christmas scene.
I see.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
Sounds quite beautiful.
If he thinks he's man enough.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
What a handsome word.
There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
Ooops.
He's dead, you know.
I've literally got to run!
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
What for?
We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
I'm utterly satisfied.
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
It's trash now, like mine.
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
He's alive!
To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.
Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
Then get him.
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
Women are always late.  You'll find out.
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
A what?
He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?
Take plenty of cigars.
I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
Meaning?
We've got to rescue him.
It's really that bad?
Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.
Penelope!  We're late!
You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
No.
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
Do you want to take a session?
Pull out your cock.
Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
How many weeks?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
Do you know where she would be?
Something like that. How much do you make?
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
But it's all you do.
Why can't I meet him now?
My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
Where is he?
But then you'll forget about me.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
I don't know.
But the police...
Do you think she's safe?
Get out.
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
Pretty good.
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Yeah.
No.
Well...
Good.
They're all about the same. You want something?
No.
You ever play Chicken?
Well, a boy goes like this, see.
I'm worried about Jake.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
You're taking a big chance.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
Yes, I am.
All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
Hello.
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Wait here.
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
Not very.
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Harold Chasen.
Nice to meet you.
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
My door is always open.
Promise?
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
I don't know. Just one of those. 
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Well, I really don't drink...
No more revolts.
Well, I don't...
But I don't play anything.
Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
Of course.
I like you, Maude.
Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
Where's that?
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
Yes. They're old friends.
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
Here.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
I have a sore throat.
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
What?
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
A rough estimate.
I wouldn't say "benefit."
Does that worry you?
No.
No.
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
Yes.
Thank you, Uncle.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
Well, I don't...
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Oh yes. That's fine.
Julia.
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
The boxes! I TOLD you.
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
Kyle, you don't have...
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
Then why are you here?
Is he serious??
Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
No. It was red. Bright red.
He's just going through a phase --
Reliquary --
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
Is it bad?
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
I knew those men better than you did --
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
Those things never work. Never.
No. Don't --
My job.
Oh-n-no -- I --
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
That's right, Stud, hold me down.
Shh! Just a second.
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
Goodnight.
No. Myers is taking me.
Red, I --
I like that...
Marco...
Coffee's warming me up.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Hi.
We're leaving.
Uh-huh.
Who are you?
No!
You did this before, right?
I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me.
It's important.
This isn't happening.
Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
Oh my God.
Tell me who you are.
Ssh!
Good.
Who?
Keep your voice down.
And the blood let you out?
Yes. They'll never find us.
I said no.
There's very little I can do about it.
I saw everything.
Oh my God.
We're going to freeze to death.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
He's BEEN here. There's stuff in the kitchen. He must have made a hasty exit.
So damn stupid.
I'll be scarred for life.
Can I get you anything?
What's wrong with you?
That depends.
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
Am I?
I found a room.
I said: I found a room.
YOU'D like my room.
You like?
Is Julia here?
I've forgotten.
I love you, honey.
What?
Finished?
I don't believe it.
I have to get out.
That's right. Cointreau.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
'Bye.
I don't know.
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.
What's next?
But now I kind of like it.
I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
Ehh.
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
How do you know about that?
Suck my ass.
How many tickets can I put you down for?
Haven't seen it.
Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
We're getting that anyway.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
On Clark Street!
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Can I help you?
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
I understand, Dick.
Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.
Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.
We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
Hi.
Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
Just the obvious stuff.
Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Just ask it!
You really think it would make a difference either way?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
Have you slept with him yet?
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
Is that the last of it?
No, no.  When are you going home?
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
Uh... No.
It'll have to be sex, then.
Hi.
Okay.
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
No, but...
You're tougher.
No use.
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
Would you marry me if I was?
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
I don't know.
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
Hey.  It's Liz.
How're you holding up?
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
Everything all right?
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
I'm Vince.
Yeah.
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
Claymore.
No thank you, I'm fine.
There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
People like that rarely leave business cards.
I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
Have you gone to the police?
Are you?
The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
Yes.
You won't.
He knows about you.
You killed those other two.
All of it finished.
No!
Four?
What makes you so sure he's the one?
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
Pheasant.
Why are you here?
Yes.  Always.
Not even a single lifetime.
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.
Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
It's like to kill me first.
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
Do what you must.
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
Not likely.
Second musketeer.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
Thanks.
Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.
I don't know.
And the Bulgarian?
Sit.
How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
Offered the Pope one of his whores.
He always did.
I've had a few more concerns.
You're wrong.
I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
And if I refuse?
American.
I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.
The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
His only kid.
I'm sure that's true.
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
Hildy!
Open this door!
No. Roy. Roy V.
Sort of a Jack London style?
It doesn't have to rhyme!
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
He certainly -- hic -- does!
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.
No. My mother.
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
How?
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
The money? Why?
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
You'll ask me to what?
Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
Just what I said. That's what I --
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
No!
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
What's his line?
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
Okay, Walter. 
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
Who did you talk to?
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
Walter!
What would you do if it was a daughter?
Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding him!
Western an' Thirty-fourth.
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
Three bullets! Any good?
What have you got, Hildy?
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
Little rum in yours, too?
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
Let go o' me. What's the idea?
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
An attempt to ruin us!
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
Throw him out, Frank.
Go on -- shoot me!
Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.
Editorials?
Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
I thought so, too.
Okay, Hildy.  Well, we can't get any official statement --
First you got to sign a receipt. 
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?
Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
They're not human!
Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!
The what?
No, I don't think so.
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
I know.
Very well, Grandpa.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
Looking for shrapnel.
I don't mind.
Bugger off.
The sodding water table.
Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
Air-raid?
What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
You need trees for an avenue.
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
That's it.
Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
Grace!
Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
My aunt in Australia has offered..
I know you mean well.
Am I? Maybe I am.
Yikes.
Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
What?
I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
What about R.J.?
Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
OK.
Come on.
OK.
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
Yeah, come on.
A dead one.
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
Yeah, I'll do something.
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
OK, Boss.
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
Where ya headed?
Quiet.
It won't work.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
Oh.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
Shhhhhh.
I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
Help, help us.
I resign.
Scattered, smothered and covered.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Huh?
What do they call you, sweety?
I don't doubt that.
Firefly.
I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
Sorry.
Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
I um... no, I don't think so...
I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
What! God damn, how many?
Fit the profile?
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Where we headed?
Over here, inside the smokehouse.
Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
Right...  ...come on.
We found one.
That is the wrong fork, young man.
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
That would be good.
Yes. Happy happy.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
Stop. Get away.
Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
God, you're beautiful.
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
That's Lila?
I don't know. Something's missing.
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
I want to be the way I was before.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
And I think I'm going to.
Lila, I want to help you.
Shut up, you.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
Paper or cloth?
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
Nathan!
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
Absolutely.
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
He looks perfectly fine.
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
Nothing. Be right out.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
You have to shave? Like an ape?
I have to think! I have to think!
You are an animal.
Good. Making progress.
Of course not.
No.
Oh boy!
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?
And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
You want a chaser?
Check!
For whom and for what?
How?
It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
You ever played billiards before?
Cut.
Yeah? Why?
Yeah. Sure, sure.
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
You think I can lose?
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
How good is he?
It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.
All right. Five hundred.
How're the hands?
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
Aaaahhhh!
What's your game? What do you shoot?
What kind of straight pool game you like?
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
Oh, come on, stop stalling. Grab yourself a cue.
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
I don't want it.
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
I asked around.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
I told you you'd get your money back.
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
Aw, Eddie.
Glad to meet you.
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
Would you like to come out tonight?
Oh no, nothing for me.
Okay?
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
Couple of bucks.
Call it.
Since four.
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
Give me a drag.
At school. It's Thursday.
Thanks.
Mm hmm.
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
What's this supposed to mean?
Is that what makes a winner?
Does it bother you? What he said?
Leave now.
Why should I?
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
That's right.
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
Let's go.
You lived like this once.
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
My wife.
Have you looked inside?
Yes.
Yes.
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
Yes.
If we want it, it is.
You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
What did it look like?
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
I'd believe him.
'Cause he wouldn't lie.
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
I don't see anything.
All their lines were busy.
There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
That's the good news?
That signal. It's a countdown.
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...
College nickname.
You can do that?
He wasn't the President then.
Moishe, please, don't talk.
I'm making a mess.
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.
Oh shit, we're late.
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
Then God help us.
Better than we thought.
It had been deemed classified.
How long would their shields be down?
Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
Well, er... it's slowing down.
It's... slowing down, Sir.
He's my angel.
I'm a dancer.
Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
We're leaving.
Yes.
Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
And I am his.
There is no museum in Iskenderun.
Yes. My treat.
It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
What is it?
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
It's war.
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
Yes?
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
Yes?
Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
What?
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
Where is it? I want it.
All I have to do is scream.
Good point.
My lucky charm.
...the solution presents itself.
What?
All right Dad -- tell me.
Booby traps?
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
Relax.
I was the next man.
More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
This could be close.
Dad, we're well out of range.
You call this archaeology?
Penitent. Penitent...
After you, Junior.
That was seven hundred years ago.
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
Come on -- come on!
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
No.
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
You should have been there...
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
You don't like him do you?
Yeah, that's what happened...
You're betrayed Shiva. 
They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
He told me they knew I was coming here.
He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.
It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
Somehow I feel safer in here.
A SNAKE!!
What?!
THE WHAT?!
I know the feeling...
Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
What does the writing say?
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...
Maybe he likes older women.
Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
No... the heart's still beating!
No... they won't kill me.
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
What for?
Willie, come on!
Al ???!!!
Don't do that.
Me.
Yes?
What street?
No.
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
What are you doing in my head, Al?
Kill myself.
Yeah.
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
Outrun them.
How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
No. Don't tell the guards.
Why?
I don't know. I don't want to find out.
You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
Take a left and your next right.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
What am I supposed to do?
We get on a plane.
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
Little late for that.
You're out of shape.
What?
It is my business. It's my name.
That place. By the window.
She's the toughest to read.
What am I supposed to do?
I don't know!
No. What will you do.
Osaka?
That's not funny.
What do I do?
I can't see a thing.
You were with GRUNER!
Probably.
GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
Where've you been?
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
Aren't we all.
Don't give her your name.
I insist.
Let us get to the border!
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
What a nerve!
He work for us?
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
He's not an ordinary man.
He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!
And how do you service foreigners.
What things?
Oh...that's okay.
Who...are you?
How do I look?
Thanks.
Well what?
Here?
Oh.
The little man in my...  ...head...
I noticed you staring.
Yessir...very good sir.
Nothing.
You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.
Yes?
Without what?
Like there's someone else here.
I just work for the travel firm.
That you're not crazy.
Why'd you run off?
You seemed interesting.
No, he didn't do that.
One chip?
Get your things.
Where would you go to sell a chip?
Hong Kong.
Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
I asked him.
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
This going to work?
I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.
I've never met anyone like you.
Why not, what are you going to do?
Do something!
...Piece of mind.
What about the others.
Why not?
Ahhh...Okay?!!!
Perfectly.
Whoever took it does.
She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
That remote control thing?
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Lowell?
Monday.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Okay.
Because he has to reveal it in a court of law. It's on record, it's out. It's no secret anymore. So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate? It's out in the world...
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
Before you go...
"Mike?"
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
Call me back in ten.
Jim, it's Lowell.
You're sure you want to do this?
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
Yes, it's on the stove...
Soy sauce...
Who's calling?
Jeffrey...
...you fucked me!
Alright.
That's right...
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
Okay. Thank you.
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
Who are these people?
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
What I've seen... I've liked.
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
Did work.
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
Tempura...
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
You charge by the hour?
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
You believe that?
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
I don't think you really understand --
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.
I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
What?
A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk.  You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes?  Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
She's okay.
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
You're gonna get your fix...
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
"There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..." "I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it."
Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
He --
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
Here. Got pictures.
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
I just want to make sure that you both --
You want Botox?
We did not.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
I should be in therapy.
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
So, that's good, right?
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
Oh boy. If he only knew.
I'll be right back.
And you must be Mr. Massey.
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
What does your lawyer think?
I know you do.
You just haven't met the right person.
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
Absolutely.
Howard is a beautiful person.
Miles?
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
She didn't love you?
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
What is it Miles?
Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
Fabric and fringe.
I bet.
I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.
What do you want?
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
Those are gifts.
Meaning my house.
You have to leave the house immediately!
Now. But first, he worked for you.
That's true.
Hello Miles.
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
I thought so.
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Marylin?
Marylin.
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
Please!
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
Of Massey Myerson?
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
Nothing.
I am very sorry.
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
Miles.
Mother?
Oh, no, sir. No different than
You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if
Yeah.
Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
Do you love her?
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do itif I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmmmmm. This filet mignon is divine!
Oh, yes. I heard.
He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
Why? Do you know him? 
I'm sorry you read it.
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today.
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one
No?  Say, listenI've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listenif you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
Sock her!
Yes, sir.
But it's King Westley on the phone.
. . . turn."
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Huh?
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
That's none of your business.
Are you talking to me!
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
Oh, this?I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
Smart aleck!
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  Youyou had it pressed.
I can't go out like this.
Heyyou're little, aren't you?
Hurry up and get dressed.
If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummerwe'd have been through with breakfast by this time.
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Well, you were!
What's the matter?
What do you meanstarvation?
To New York?
I'm following you.
You're prejudiced.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
What if nobody stops for us?
There's no end to your accomplishments.
Oh, no!
Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
Mind your own business.
What for?
Come on! come on! 
Darling!
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
You bet I did.
Not interested. 
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
Yeah.
Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
Wait a minute, GordonI
Don't "Joe" me.
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsand I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
That she's going to marry somebody else.
Well, I got it, Joe.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
For heaven's sake, Joestop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
Okay, pete. 
I dunno.
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is"  No, do you really?
Collect?
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
Zeke.  Git!
Thanks. 
What?
You're a pretty shrewd baby.  We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
SuresureI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
No.
Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
Yeah, I guess you do.
...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
What's the other name?
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
I did.
No, I did not.
What did they...
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.
Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
Huh?
I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
Who?
The Warren Commission call him?
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
More than ten years.
If you buy what you read in the paper.
Was he there often?
Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  We've obviously got the bastards worried now.  I'm going to Washington.
She's the best damn witness we have!
He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
And what would I have to do?
How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
Oh, that's not a problem.
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
I know. That's why I went.
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
Let me finish. Can I finish?
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
I'm not saying another word.
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.  Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?
While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
Can you do it or not?
Okay.
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
It's kind of a sports bar
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
Shit.
Ordell pick up his bond?
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
I am. Have a seat.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
Why?
You're not old. You look great.
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
I go back to work tomorrow.
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
When did you decide?
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
That's my job.
I believe I said I'd be tempted.
That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
In the bag underneath.
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
It's not that simple.
Less ten percent.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
With the prior? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge. You want to think about it? You got two minutes before we're up.
Then you don't see him for a few days?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
No.
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
I thought you were going to let this one through.
A Broadway shopping bag.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Who's the other one?
What's her story?
She told you that?
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
You'd take a polygraph on it?
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
Beaumont Livingston?
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
Thanks.
I knew it.
I didn't tell 'em anything.
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
I do okay.
That's a good idea.
But you don't?
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
I need to talk to you alone.
What the hell you talkin' bout?
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
Where you gonna be during all this?
We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
Yeah, there's another hit left.
What's a Metrix?
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
We had done time together already.
I don't like dancing.
You been to Japan?
Who's arm is that?
Must of made quite an impression.
That sounds like a problem.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Yeah, down the end.
Okay, Lou-is.
Who's your partner?
What's your cost?
An employee I had to let go.
But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
Twice. In the parking lot.
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
Uh-huh.
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
That's right.
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
Tell me.
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B- I-E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton 90222.
Hear what?
Beaumont worked for you.
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
Is that what I think it is?
I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
I thought you might be asleep.
Git your ass in here.
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
Call her, tell her the combination.
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
I know where it is.
No.
Let me speak to Max Cherry.
Where do you want to go?
No! Oh God.
Della?
I see.
How do you know?
What do you want from me?
Oh, terrific.
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
Why do you say that?
She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
You should go back to her.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
I'm walking, aren't I?
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
I don't know what to say.
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
Hell, you think I am?
It's freezing.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
Go to sleep.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
Your back? Did you fall?
Who did?
Thanks.
What do you mean?
I don't let anybody call me that.
I don't like things that make you cry.
What's wrong?
They're like demons, Jez.
Where's Della? Bring her here?
Show me Della!
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
Get your clothes off.
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
That's your decision.
I love you, Jez.
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
What? What do you mean?
Stay away from me, Jez.
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
Sit down, Jake.
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
Sit down!
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Like it was yesterday.
Well that's good to know.
What is wrong with you?
Paul Gruneger!
I need to see you, Jake.
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
What's goin' on Paul?
They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
Bring it in.
Pause play.
Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
Yes it does.
What do you mean, not enough time?
If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
He came for me, I had to run!
And you said high school was boring.
What are you gonna do, tell me?
I'm coming, I'm coming.
We could convert fission transistors.
Then stop talking and work faster!
Where is he?
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
I'm pulling, damnit!
I hope so.
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
I thought you meant...
Not so bad.
Okay, good tip.
I get it.
No shit. I got no problem with that.
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
He's right behind us!
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
Shut up, Thorgan!
NO!
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
That ought'a help the situation.
Let's just get out of here.
Would you?
Later.
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Crutch?
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
Kay-em 14.
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could.
We're missing two of the kids!
Ssh.
Then open the doors!
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
Nanotechnology.
But...I...400 years?
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
It's okay.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
Full throttle! To port!
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
I never hear the whistle.
Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
Michael! Come inside!
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin.
I didn't agree to that!
Let's all have a drink.
Rogue?
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
What do we do?
Chum?
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
I wish it would rain...
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
Get out of there  take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
He's busy.
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
Let it go, don't waste your time.
Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
He's under!
I'm not hungry, oddly.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
What?
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Oh, hey Vijay.
Excuse me?
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
What are you talking about?
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
What do you play?
You weren't even alive!
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
Yeah?
Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
You don't have to do that.
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
That suits you.
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
Why?
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
You're gonna like this, I promise.
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
What are you?
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
But you're old!
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
Nothing.
Congrats.
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
That is sick, man.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
Right, seriously.
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
Carrie.
...Yeah, sure.
It's a portfolio of my work.
Jeez... Adele!
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
A book on the warehouse murders?
Funny, very funny.
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
...Brian hurt his foot.
No, never. Excuse me.
What is it?
Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.
Where would we find him?
...That'd be my guess.
Yes.
Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
Yeah.
Right.
To what? Virgins?
What for? That guys a dick.
You think he's got any herb?
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
Yeah.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
Bet.
Why I do what?
Good luck?
Yeah probably.
Why not? You stink.
Right here.
Na.
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
You have?
You were?
Yes.
How do you know?
Nothing?
Do you care about me?
No...
Yeah.
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
I wouldn't believe it?
Do you care about me?
But I only had sex with Telly.
No.
Yeah?
Hell yeah, they don't know.
Good luck.
No. I just gotta go find him.
Yeah?
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
Whah is dissdee?
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
Oh god. That's horrible.
Holy shit. That's all true?
Shh.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
It's me. Telly.
He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
Yes.
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
I wouldn't know.
How'd you get in here?
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
He's one of the best Chess players in the world.  Who better to play a game with?
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective.  You can't possibly be unbiased.
I haven't got time for this.
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
You like to brag, don't you?
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
The police haven't told you?
I've figured out the message.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
Very good.  How did you know?
Thanks.
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
Uh huh.
He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?
Boys.
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
Bingo.
We're not sure.
We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
It's important.
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
Anything else?
That's a big area to cover.
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
I got it from the tournament directory.
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
Yes.
No.  I don't.
Uh huh.
Yes.
Are we talking about me, or chess?
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
Let's change the subject.
No.
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
No.  You were talking about chess.
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
Call room service.
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
You don't understand.
I don't have to go through with it either.
Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
That's worse.
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
Yes.
Turold's son was to marry her.
The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
I'm not sure.
The Beast will kill her.
Where the spiral begins.
I chose the wrong passage.
I forbid you!
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
I cannot betray my bride.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
How did you know I had sons?
You will follow me.
So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
That I promise you.
I'm all right.
Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
Subject to the King, no doubt.
No.
I have a cinnamon bar.
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
I don't think it's working.
Would you desert your friends?
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
Many have perished in that maze.
Yes.  Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved.
The Widow of the Web?
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
No, she was not as beautiful.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
You lie!
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
Yeah... How do you know it?
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
No.
...What?
Yeah.
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Huh... 500 meters?
Yes, yes...
I killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... I left nothing for you!
Yes.
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
Why?
OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
Yes.
...Yes.
I have no fear.
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
Can I sit on the stairways now?
Messina.
I know... But I'm a little pressed.
Salute.
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
I'll make it.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
How serious is it?
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
Thank you.
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
It's just a regular day.
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
You're talking to me?
Then why?
He's plastered.
I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
Not our problem.
Not our problem.
This guy's not a murderer.
Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home.  Why?
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
You tell stories?
That's me.
By car right?
Mammoth.
California.
I always knew you had good instincts...  Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I get back.
I was thinking you could open another store with investors.  I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now.
Saluting.
What, come on?
No more words.  Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.
Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Hello.
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
No.
No.
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
No -- S.E.R.A.
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
You do?
Is that really what you want to ask me?
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
What?
Sorry.
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
Yeah... I'd like that.
Let's stay for a while.
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
How much, do you think?
I want this, Sera. I need this!
Where have you been staying?
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
I have a 4.0.
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
Go to hell.
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
No, she'd stashed it by then.
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
Thank you!
I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
Just the love in my heart.
Aristotle.
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
I'm so happy for you!
Licensed attorney or family member?
Relation?
Really?
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --
Power yoga?
I will...
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
Wow. I'm glad I met you.
Thanks again for your help!
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
How do you figure?
No, she can't move for an hour.
Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
For a butt-head? Yes.
What?!
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
Are you asking me on a date?
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
Is he the only one?
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
Absolutely!
Why not?
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
Then what? My boobs are too big?
Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  How was your summer?
Do anything exciting?
Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
Thank you.
Really?
Yes.
Chuck.
I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
It's not a Theta --
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
Wait -- Cecil has a condo in Tahoe. Let's go there!
Pull up next to him!
Then we smash 'em?
No.  Smashing is not required.  I have a surprise for our tiny invaders... Raise that hatch!
Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
Grotesque... monstrous...
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
I don't expect you'd understand.
Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
Oh no... Don't you understand?
Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
Who might these friends be?
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
Didn't you now?  Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
And who might that be?
Something's coming.
Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
Whatever for?
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Blackheart?
That would be Devil's Needle.  Last landmark I know in these woods.
Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.
We'll find it.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
Nay.  This time we strike first!
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
Fire away!
It doesn't matter.
... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
Can you save her?
Mean you to seek him out below?
What weapon?
He'll not escape me.
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
Very thrifty.  Even got your arrow back.
Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
They'll do nicely.
If you like.
Be patient.
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
To fetch your napkin.
My own father...
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
Ask away, sweet man.
Dead, dead, dead.
Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
And am I not fair?
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
We wait.
Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
Small miracles better than no miracles...
No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
Don't speak to me of dreams!  I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
Sam!
Mom said I should.
I would have anyway.
Who are all these people?
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
Let's shut up and not kill her.
I don't know.
He jumped into the ocean.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
Yeah.
I'm not gay.
What?
Not if what he left me was real.
He's got a standing invitation.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
If that's what it takes.
It's thirty feet.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
how much weight have you lost?
How's your wife?
He buys and sells the world.
We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
I hate this job.
What can I do for you, George?
She didn't really say.
Thank you.
I'll ask.
No.
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
You'll have money when you work for it.
Hey...hey!
A friend of yours is here.
Sit down for a second.
How do you become something you're not?
What I'm not.
What do you know about me?
Getting high, I guess.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
That's so weird...
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
Thanks for telling me.
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
Oh.  Sorry.
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
Money?
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
I don't have a phone.
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
Well, for later then.
I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
I dreamed about your house last night.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
You're not well.
He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
I think so.
Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
Left you?
Does Alyssa know?
Who?
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
You can't go because of Sam?
I didn't go in your room.
Can you stay for dinner?
I don't know what I'm doing.
Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
Someone stop her!
Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!
Better make it a week.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
Then what's the problem?
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
Take care of me?
Yes, sir.
Sure, boss.
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
But I'm having a good time...
Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
I don't think so.
I don't see where that's any of your business.
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
Still got that ten dollars?
We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
I said you're soft.
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?!
Say what?
I don't know. Who do you want?
What am I gonna eat?
I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
Whatever.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
Hey, there's Wilkins!
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
I said you're soft.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
So?
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
I try to moisturize regularly.
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
What were they, bootleggers?
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
Understood.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
And he's dead serious.
...their damned souls will be ours.
Noon...
Sure, why not?
You want a queen? Got one right here.
Well tell her I said "hi" back.
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
I think you're looking at him.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
Coulda been much worse.
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
Oh, would you grow up.
Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
That way.
You keep a bat under your seat?
Yes, great movie...
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
My dad's an optometrist.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
If you want to.
School?
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
What was that?
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
From my dad's side of the family.
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
See something you like, my man?
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
From? From? From?
Where do we go?!  Where do we go from here??!!
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
I'm in my party mood.
Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
No.
No.
Curious.
How a Sandman lives.
Not about that.
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
All right.
I let him go... believe me.
What do you need?
That's tomorrow.
Maybe you'll think of something...
Of course --
We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
He's good, isn't he?
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
We'll be all right...  We will...
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
It could be...
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
To what?
Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
I don't know.
What's that?
Where are you going?
What makes you think so?
Yes...
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
What?
Yes, I thought my wife...
What do you mean by that?
Or not so recently?
There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
Me, too.
It's me...
I can't see you tonight.
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
I used to.
Why are ya goin' so early?
Oh, yeah?... What else?
We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
The wife killer?
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
No, sir, it's not.
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
Pete, what happened to you?
A headache?
I... I didn't say anything...
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
Alice who?
I like to laugh, Fred.
Wake me up when you get home.
I guess so.
All right.
But...
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Pornos?
Okay.
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
Sorry... I...
I don't remember... What happened that night?
Whatiya mean?
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
I do like you, Sheila.
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
Yeah.
Come on.
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
What's the BITCH'S name?!
YOU'RE SORRY!!
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
Oh, read it!
I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
Fossils.
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
Okay, brother.
Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
I'm thinking.
You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
Sounds like a stall to me.
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
In a quandary.
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
Well - I'm
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
That's intelligent.
You have no disputes over women?
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
Shall we have another?
Yes, charming.
Suppose she should leave it?
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
Splendid!
Pardon me
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
Father Perrault is dead.
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
Oh, the girl at the piano?
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
Yes.
Right, Bob.
Yes.
Do try to sleep, Bob.
The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
Nothing about the porters yet?
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Porters?
Why - I'm sorry - but I
George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
Is that all my story meant to you?
She's going with me.
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
In for what?
Why, you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
We'd be eternally grateful if you
Oh, you mean my pigeons.
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
Yes, I know.
You see, it's not a dream.
Why, mother?
Go? Where?
Please don't go.
Perhaps.
Hesitated, sir.
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
What the hell...
And Goodwill Toward Man?
And if I say yes?
Yes, sir.
Well this didn't.
Actually, sir--
I'd go with number three.
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
Kay...
What?
We wear black.
Right.
So what's the problem?
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
It was a long time ago.-
You don't know me at all.
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
Where to?
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
Kay.  All I'm saying--
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
In case I need it.
Kay!?
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
Actually... I don't know.
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
How could it not?
Come on now.  People are smart.
Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
We've got about eight or nine prospects	I want you look--
Yeah, Kay?
Actually, yeah--
They're not my pals--
This guy.  Where was he?
Scientific American?  Really?
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
They went right to the President.
Oh shit!
Can you see?
They're inside.
Can you see the balloon man?
Forget that guy --
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
Someplace safe.
Agatha, you're never going back there.
She died?
Oh, Jesus...
I know... I do, too...
How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
That's comforting.
It's all I could safely move.
We know each other?
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
I can't even stand up --
... Graveyard shift.
Try again.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
Uh-huh...
I understand.  Sir.
Yes, sir.
I go running down there.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
I'm not getting halo'd.
All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
Everybody runs.
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
Sir?
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
Just a nickname.
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
That's right.
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
Good-bye, Dad...
Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
NO!
I'm a little dizzy...
I'm... not... a... killer.
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
And how did Lamar become involved?
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
The system would collapse.
Hold that thought.
If... you have one.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
You look great.
I thought you were retiring?
Tell him not now.
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
None of your damn business.
What?
Where are you?
Wait, just a second...
How?
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
I wanna kill my boss.
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
There's thousands of units like this one.
Sure.  Raincheck.
I know who you are.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
Have you been there recently?
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
Yeah. Take it.
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
No.
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
Who's watching the baby?
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
With what?
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
No.
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
Ricky's taken care of.
This one?
She was fast, huh?
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
Yeah. Sorry.
Yeah.
Ruiz knows about this?
He'll work it off.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
What is it?
I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
Where's the drop?
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Well, this is the corner.
No. That's cool, man.
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Listen, man, we really gotta...
Don't be shitty.
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
Yeah. I know the number.
I will.
Bye.
Shhh...
Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early...
He didn't say we need guns.
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
What are we delivering?
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
They asked who it was.
What the fuck do you...
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
So we're working?
About what?
You want us strapped, don't you?
Why?
They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
Easy...
I'll be a minute.
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
I didn't do anything --
The line's over there.
Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
He's on the list.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
The videos.
Drinks are free, right?
Where do you live?
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
What? Why am I bad?
I'll tell him someone else told me.
Watch it...
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
No. What is it?
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
But, Max --
A rose by any other name would --
Bet you like that shit.
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
Just now.
What?
Nnnnnnn!
Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
You never had it.
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
You know it.
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
A black man playing big league ball is something.
Then the devil is white.
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
Tell Him that.
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.
And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
How do you like it?
There's nothing to talk about.
Why do you ask?
I know.
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
Hush your mouth.
I'm not made of glass.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
Shhh!
Betty it's me. It's me.
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
I'm tired of praying.
Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
That's right.
I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
Entirely.
Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one.
Let me do it then.
Say what you're saying.
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
Your control over your children, therefore --
How long has this been going on?
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
You better believe it.
What's your story, baby?
Me?
Well, all reet, then.
Shorty, this is Laura.
Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
He told you that?
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
[South America.]
I guess that makes you the smart one.
[We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[Where do I find him?]
[It's non-negotiable.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
Yes.
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
I drink.
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
Different door. Not far from here.
If they like me.
The United States.
How do you think he got out?
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
Yeah. Two or three.
I'm sorry.
Your father has business.
I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
Still not a question.
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
Dyslexic?
Never.
No.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
Because...  I was already dead.
Planned what?
It's Creasy.
What was her name?
She understands men.
[Yes.]
[OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle and Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will drive around the square two times. Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to I.D. the car.]
We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
You do?
Don't forget your towel.
Our daughter.
[He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
I can take care of myself.
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
What?
Which one was that?
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
I know it pains.
Your son Marty?
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
I'm thirty-four.
Thank you.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
Please...
Nothing.
I'll wait for your call.
How do you do?
We just live one flight up.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
Sure.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
No, listen, that's my mother, I'm gonna pay for her...
Sure, great if you ain't married.
You gonna get married.
Sure.
Hiya, Ralph...
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
Hello, Thomas.
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
I don't wanna talk about it!
Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
Home.
That's right.
Pour one for Painless.
Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
What the hell's going on here?
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
Duke Forrest.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?
We been had.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
The chest-cutter.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
People will talk.
I can't... couldn't.
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
N-n-no thanks, G-General.
You betcher ass, General.
Right.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
No, no, that one.
But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
Oh, Jesus.
Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
Not necessarily.
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
It's possible
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
Ayuh.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
That. It's out of the act.
He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Damn.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
It's a technique Ugly John and I worked out in case something like this came up.
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
He likes you well enough to stick around.
Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
No, thank you.
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
Yes, I did, John. But II had no idea what was going on.
Money.
All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
No, no, nothat's your seat.
A third party?
Mr. D. B. Norton!
All set, Ann?
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
John Doe.
Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
That's all, Ned. Thank you.
Plus a bonus.
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
No, no, no. Now that's too much!
I ain't seen him for a week.
Beany!
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
Naw.
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?
There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
It must be some kind of a gag.
A gag. A gag!
Yeah? Well, you can have it!
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
You betcha.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
Well?
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.  Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appearand in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.
Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.
No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
Did you want to see her about something important?
Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
Feller runs the Chronicle .  Here's the speech you makeand it's all written out for you.
Yeah.
Shh!
SWAT wants to go in.
Deal.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
Of course.
So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
Then where's my FUCKING car!
Am I gettin' the car?
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
Solis said to keep you clear of this.
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
Yep.
You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
Is there something wrong with that?
We could fill it with water.
Thou shall have no other God before me.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
Yeah, first and second.
Good question.
I ain't interested in your life story.
She's the one to blame. Not me.
And why the fuck would you do that for me?
You worship yourself.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
...Let me just show you.
In Europe women find older men very sexy.
And you think he'll...
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
What do you think would be in order?
I want to be put on this case.
Who's running it!
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
True.
To live forever.
-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
Someone who believes in miracles.
Yes.
In a computer program.
-- Two million people plugged-in here.
At least a day.
What about the customers with reservations?
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
-- Yes.
Go!
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
Why would I do that?
If she's alive, you get it back.
-- Katie.
No.
Her?
Activated.
Resurrection.
Destination?
Wait a second...  What time is it?
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
What?!
WHITE TIGER!
Activating Power Beam!
Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!
LET'S FLY!
By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja.  It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
Look closer.
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
Wait for me!
Quack like a'duck!
GO IVAN!!
So they've been destroyed?
What do you mean "basically"?
From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions!
And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!
But I've never served a day.
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
Not another word.
Scared.
He was around...
Which is why he doesn't need us.
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
I needed to see you again.
You're sure?
Gives us something in common.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
Never threaten me, Boss.
He's trying to make it.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
The kid just called me stupid.
Don, I'd be honored.
Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
I don't fuck my partners.
You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
Okay. I'm listening.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
Come on. Be polite.
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
Kill them! Kill them!
But only on purpose, Tommy.
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
Switch hands.
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
Bend over?
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
Maybe you could talk to Death!
Monkeybone...!?
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
When'd you get in?
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
The ring...
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
<u>What</u> union?
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!
Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do.
Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
I don't <u>know</u>.
We like to think so, yeah.
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
Behind the books.
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
I'm sorry.
Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
What does he do?
... Manly?
Yeah.
This way?
Thirty is base price.  Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.
Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
I did not--
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
You know--little worms--ambition.
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
I apologize.
Tunnel?
What?
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
Great saints!
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--
Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.
Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Me! Jim--how--?
Aw--
Ma! Hold him!
Is *what* getting me down?
Than what?
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
I beg your pardon?
The porter's got them. They're coming.
Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
Oh, I couldn't tonight. Thanks a lot.
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or--
For one week!
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
Nonsense, Jeff.
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
No, Jeff--please--!
Jefferson--
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
There *what* was?
Punch?
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
I know--but you--you're going to help.
Oh, but this one is so simple.
And with your help--
Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
What's that?
*This* is.
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
Try sitting down.
Since sixteen or so.
Why?
You win. It's--Clarissa.
In Terry Canyon?
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
Don't mention it--
Are you drunk?
Saunders--
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
Wait--
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
Splendid.
Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!
Ring the call to quorum.
Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.
Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
What's the matter?
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
Susan!
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
No?
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
Just a minute, Joe!
*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
Maybe he won't get up.
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
Sometimes twice.
Oh yes, pixilated.
Uh-huh.
Sometimes he whistles.
No.
I haven't.
Yes!
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
Oh - uh - nothing.
No. That is, I didn't  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
Oh, I don't mind.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
Oh, that
You have?
What did he play?
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
I'd like to read it some time.
I'll get my hat.
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
Are you? When?
Oh, hello darling.
No. It's nothing.
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
Uh-huh.
Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
John
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
Proceed.
Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
You can't?
Yeah?
Why, no.
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
What for?
Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
No, thanks.
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Nah.
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
No, thanks.
Uh-huh.
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
We own an opera house, don't we?
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
Ja.
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
Well, I play the tuba.
Yes?
Not at all.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
I write poetry.
Don't pay any attention to her.
Now you keep out of this!
I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
South Dakota - but on the top.
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Thank you so much. Good night.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
Prairie? Oysters?
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
You have no pants, sir.
What, sir?
Hmm?
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
Ernest, what do you think?
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! Are we listening to Lionel now?
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
Now we're back on track.
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
What do you do?
A little.
What?
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
Why do you watch?
He told you.
Okay.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
That would explain it.
We're going for a walk.
Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
Is she against you getting help?
Uh-huh.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
Yes.
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
You like it?
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
Yeah?
Transference.
Which show was that?
Will you be here?
What do you mean, "in no time"?
Weekly or monthly?
It's a big part of the show.
It's called pro bono.
It's my bit for the community.
What do you want me to see?
Really?
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Good-looking woman.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
Uh-huh.
I wondered what happened to her...
It's just a thought.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
Jerking off?
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
Holy shit!
You were messed up, man.
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
All new people start with that...
No... no training.
English Lit.
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
Really?
What'd I do?
Wow.
When?
I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
You're not going to kill us?
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
And then killing your sister.
Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
You always did have more balls than brains.
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
Perhaps.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
You will not believe it.
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
Water turning to blood.
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
I am an English woman.
Twenty.
Broad?!
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
You swear?
Really want to know?
Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
I know my treasure.
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
Who was talking about what?
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
No you're not.
Because that's my name.
Very slowly.
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
Yes?
That just makes you more gullible.
Still...
Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
I know you knew I'd know.
Fantasizing... about you.
One last tweak.
I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
Really?
So who killed him?
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
Atta, boy!
But you're a superhero.
Or even what it looks like.
Hello?
Think positive.
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
You're nuts.
Frankenstein!
Not tonight. 
That was easy. 
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
Roy.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
What are you talking about?
What?
Monica!
And you are a fool.
When are you going to take off that mask?
My heart died a long time ago.
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
LOOK!
How could I see him if he's invisible?
Yeah.
But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
There's a vague similarity.
Because I can't! Okay? She wouldn't understand!
See ya tomorrow.
The Eradicators!
Hey... he's gone.
We're superheroes.
Ow.
Oh hi, Mom.
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
Who are they?
Yeah, but how do we get to them?
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
It's suicide.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
Fair enough.
A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
And where is Joseph?
Bertrand, sire.
Yes, sire?
No, sire... I was asleep.
Yes, sir.
I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night.
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
Oh?
No, sir.
Yes -- an excellent idea.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
I'll have the fire built up.
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Lisette.
Lisette La Croix.
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.
Not even the slightest hint of something?
And you, Junot?
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
Promises mean nothing.
What are you doing in there?
Five minutes.
Yes.
It's me.
Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
I couldn't face telling you.
My God, what do you think?
Yes?
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
Yes, I do -- very much.
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.
No.
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
Yes, he has.
We have a treaty with Austria.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
Yes, sir.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me.  It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
Anything you need.
That's it?
Naw, it ain't like that.
Alright, I'll remember that.
Thanks, Unc.
Yeah.
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
Good.
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
Yup.
You know what he mean, dude.
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
You don't know Baby D.
Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
You already in.
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
Ain't no windows in here.
I don't know.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
Come on.
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
You damn right that's the big one.
You don't wanna know.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
R-U-S-H Intensely.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
Let it go!
Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
Where's Craig?
Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.
Call me.
Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
I don't know, Debo.
What?
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
What's the matter?
That's my girl.
What?
What?
Of course.  I wish everything were that easy.
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
What's your point?
Then I have time for a drink.
Tell me why I miss him.
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
Keep your voice down.
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
No, please...
I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
On TV.
No way.
Nods.
Over and out.
Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
Hi.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
I don't think so.
I see. Where is this gun?
You're a big girl, huh?
Help me get her off the rug.
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Where?
Come with me, honey.
I kill her anyway.
Go ahead, sugar Die.
'Daddy has to go now.
I been mindin' Pearl.
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
There hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook Mister Gar. What a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair.
No.
But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
Bluebeard!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
Amen.
How?
There! What's so hard about that!
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
'Cause you're too little.
Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
John, where are we g --
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
Dead.
I'll make coffee.
Huh?
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
It -- she --
Under the stone in the floor.
Come to me, boy!
All right.
No.
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
It's about that John and that Pearl?
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
Where's she at?
Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
Didn't you hear me, boy?
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
Now who was this?
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
Thank God.
Get the kit!
Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
No.
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
My dream.
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
It wasn't that serious...
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
Right home after. See you.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
Put that damned thing down!
Just sleep now, Mom.
We should get her out of here...
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
Nobody's gonna kill you.
You were screaming like crazy.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
He's nuts about you.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
About what?
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
And there?
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
Possibly.
Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
Right now it's on the balcony.
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
What is it?
And they might believe her in Moscow.
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
How many families live here with you?
Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
No, no.
Don't worry... there will be enough.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
Good morning, Gaston.
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
Are they indeed? Thank you.
Certainly.
Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
While you eat, you look at the view.
...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
Get out of here!
Razinin.
Look for yourselves.
Monsieur.
Yes, Comrade.
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
Well, we're back home.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
You believe in our cause?
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
No visa.
Gladly.
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
He takes good care of that.
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Wounded? How?
It's twelve o'clock.
But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer.
Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
Why?
I don't think so.
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...
My darling.
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
A funny story?
You must, darling.
Darling, darling... please!
No speech?
All right, we'll make it red.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
They belong to the people.
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
Oh, yes.
Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
What does he say?
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
Is this your new dress suit?
How do you do?
No... please...
A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
Yes.
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
What?
Madame, if you...
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
Why?
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
Yes, it does.
Thank you.
May I ask what has happened?
Yes... leaving immediately.
This will do. 
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
I like that.  That's a solution.
Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
Yes ... I got the money.
Yeah, I knew it.  I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ...
'Cause he hates you.  It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
No, sir.
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
I thought the gloves were off.
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
He's completely lost touch with reality.
It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
And if I stay?
That's right ...
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us?
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
How is this national security?
Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you.
These kids are being manipulated by the Communists.  Like Chambers and Hiss.
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ...
This could be it ... this could be it. Four long years ...
My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
What about the documents he promised?
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
How about you?  Are you going to win?
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: "The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up."  The Communists have never been closer.  Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  Let the Communists know you're onto them.
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
It won't.  As long as I'm here.
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
Yes.  My mother used to pray ... a lot.  It's been a long time since I really prayed.  Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little.
How a fat man gets so many girls.
Just ... uh ... you know.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...
... but it was all we had.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
Yes, I understand that.
The hell with 'em.
Sir?
Sir?
Yes, yes.
No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
Are you serious?
Will you ... would you kiss me?
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
They're all your enemies?
Thank you.
Lost.
The "crises"?
Who else'd be in your truck.
How's that?
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
I don't know. My mind wanders.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
Yessir. We should a brought wieners.
The old boy shot by the highway?
You sure?
Llewelyn Moss?
You figure him for a dope runner?
Gun out and up.
Believe you're right.
The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.
Hyah!
I didn't see my Prednizone.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
Yes. Things fall into place.
No. I found it.
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
You should be used to that.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
If you knew, you would have it with you.
It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
In the truck.  I'll get it.
Not a bleep.
So what're you goin' up there for.
Sixty-nine cent.
You live in that house behind the store?
You married into it.
Call it?
I didn't put nothin' up.
...Where you want me to put it?
Somethin' like that.
There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
No sir, it's unusual.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
Yessir. I understand that.
I'm sorry.
You want to change rooms?
Another additional.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
Sugar?
I know how he found me.
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
I didn't say braze.
Yeah. I was in Nam.
I don't know. American citizens.
You do, I reckon.
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
Oww! My arm, careful!
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
Little place called "Williams," why?
Oh. How come?
They're fine... you miss it?
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
"Thirty-two?"
I better go check on them.
...what're you saying?
I don't think I am.
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
What are you talking about?
Do what?
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
You're late, Eric.
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
Didn't I?
Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
What's so special about it?
Roy! What are you doing here?
Los Angeles, California.
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
That's horrible!
What's his real name?
You made out alright.
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
...did I win some contest?
No, that's not, I couldn't...
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
Fine.
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
You never know who you'll see.
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
Ahh... my wife's.
If we're for real?
I don't follow...
No...
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
Hell of a way to die.
IT SURE IS!!
I wanted to make a statement.
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
Half.
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
Well... I think I saw her soul.
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
Very graceful. Perfect form.
...who doesn't?
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
I'll think about it.
I said I'll think about it.
That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
Then do as you're told. Get her back.
Sure.
Would you say she was ambitious?
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
Yeah. Why, you know him?
David Ravell.
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
Good Lord, what do we do?
Gopher, Everett?
Where's Tommy?
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
Campaign manager? Waldrip.
Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
Helluva awgazation.
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
That's right, honey.
That wasn't my doing...
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
It was in his bureau.
Well that hardly sounds like you...
Aw, that's all right.
But... but...
Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -
Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
I am. Hur you?
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
What for?
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
Naw. That's over with.
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
Come over here where I can see you.
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
Aw screw it...
Yes, sir!
No, sir.
Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Yeah.
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
I'm a little late, that's all.
Let's just wait and see what happens.
Well, I'll be goddamned.
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Everything was different.
Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
Be a friend. Leave.
I know who you are and what you want.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
Why'd he do it?
Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.
Hey, Sid, thanks.
Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
Sure.
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room.
I can't...
I can't just...
You finish.  Then we finish.
I know.
Shut up and let me think.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
They're gonna die in there!
Everything okay?
Huh?
He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
Why?
I don't think so, but I love her album.
Got us in here, didn't I?
Well, I know that now.
What do they want?
Wait.
Feel okay?
I saw something, I saw...
I was trying not to tell you...
Oh shit Alma... you're...
What?!? Don't tell me you're buying this?
You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.
They mean, Pig!, that the Black Panther Party declares that if you try to brutalize our community or take our weapons.  We are going to shoot you!!!
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
What's with you?
Yeah, it's me.
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
You know that's bullshit.
Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
No man. PE -- "political education."
Can you make a deal with them?
That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
We need money first...
No! Just harassment. Can't let it stop this.  Brother we got momentum!
So talk...
You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
I don't know about that.
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
Yeah.
Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station.
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
Later for that. I'm done either way...
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
I don't know. I really don't.
Thank you.
Uh... uh... I...
That would be nice.
That would be nice, too.
I expect to try.
You got me beat on both accounts.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
Goodbye.
That one is a bit more difficult.
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen.
Sir.
Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.
Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?
The middle colonies?
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
Not yet.  What happened?
Yes, sir.
Yes...  ... father.
Flanking riders?
Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
And what do they know?
I'm not my mother.  I can't have the respect without the knowing.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
I stand corrected.
I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...
That's five, keep going...
That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
Goodbye, Harry.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
Earned.
Remember Braddock?
You'll see soon enough, hon.
Is that right, dad?
Am I really gonna have my own room?
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
I hate that smell.
You believe in it.
Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
Does she love the cat?
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
Is there quicksand?
Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
You keep saying that.
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
What?
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
It's Ellie's cat.
Shit! Look at this mess!
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
Louis, the house is beautiful.
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
Elizabeth goes free!
And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
He didn't waste it.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Now.  No, don't kill him.
By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
Very well.
Can I trust you?
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Will -- you can't trust him.
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
The trees are taller.
What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two --
Nor did you, I noticed.
I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
She can hold a bit longer.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
Sorry, I didn't know.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
Pirate.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone.  I see no profit in it for me.
How?  The key's run off.
Agreed!
My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
'Bootstrap?'
The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
Depends.
On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --
My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
Yes.
Yes, I have.
If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
No.  She hasn't.
Until he's done.
Speak.
Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something.
How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
It's ready now, I know it is.
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
That remains to be seen.
Why are there two ottomans?
Okay, arms up, lean forward.
Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
Shut up and do it!
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
I want Trix!  Mommy!
You better quit pushing me, pal.
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
What did he want?
Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
So, I guess it worked.
Same old Daniel.
Yeah, we'll see.
Mouse?  What mouse?
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
Three days ago it was.
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
The nanobot... it's not here...
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
Getting used to it.
Let's go.
Did you think I could just leave you...?
Yes.
I remember I was trying to help...
Oh yeah?
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
Dexter.
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
You may go, Smythe.
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
Of course I am Stewart.
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
Oh boy, I'd love it.
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
My play.
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.
Oh no, sir!
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
Yes, of course. I'll get it for you
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Nothing.
Must be my wife.
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Right.
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
Yeah?
Sorry, boss
There's nothing sudden about that  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
I have it here.
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
You don't.
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
I beg your pardon.
It's all right. Bring him in.
Have you seen this? 
To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! "I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers!
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
Well sir, I'll show you.
That's all I wanted to know!
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
Sure.
Yes.
Looks just like it did.
Thanks ... I love you.
Thanks.
Bud brought it to me.
Yes she is.
I've got to go ...
No ...
But I really should get home.
Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
All night?
Um ... It's ...
Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
... Lover's Lane.
Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to.
I think ... I might be ill ...
What?
No it couldn't!
Oh, no thanks ...
No. Of course not.
Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
Rain.
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
Yes I did.
Still doesn't make it right.
It was accessible to everyone.
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
What?
I thought the books were blank?
What are you doing?
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
Yeah. Every episode ever.
What's going to happen?
Neither do I.
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
He won't notice anyway.
Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
They don't have that kind of potential.
Really? It seems so fattening.
Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Wow.
What?
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
Oh ... Hi.
Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
What department store did they go to?
Ooomph?
Because we don't belong!
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
I can't.
Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
Why?
They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.
What?
Yes.
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Yeah.
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
TV repair?
Yeah ...
You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Cool.
So you can't talk to me?
Why?
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
It's fine, but --
I feel really on the spot now.
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
Call me later.
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
I....please don't do this.
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
Hi, is this Jack?
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
I'm in my bedroom.
You have a girlfriend?
...yeah.....
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
I don't have a girlfriend --
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
This is not cool.
No.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Ok.
No. I'm the exact opposite --
It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
Sure.
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
You were talking about the promotion --
Yeah.
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
...yeah...
If you come to Hawaii --
This is Lena.
Thank you.
This really looks like Hawaii here.
Yeah.
It's ok to ask that.
What is this?
You left me at the hospital.
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
Did you do it?
You're hand is bleeding.
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
Can you say that my name is Jack?
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
What?
You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --
I think you have a call?
....I have seven.
Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?
That was weird. I meant good.
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
Hi, Lance.
You're goin' on a trip?
WHICH?
....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
Wait a minute --
Is this where you live?
Alright, alright.
What is this, man?
What are you doing?
Seriously.
Yeah but I'm serious.
Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
You ready?
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
By whom? The Marquis?
Why not?
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
Your wig. Remove your wig.
An innocent child is dead.
AND DID YOU?
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
Why was it you never took her by force?
Was it impotence?
Then it must've been love --
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
His wife's influence.
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
Shut down?
And place my reputation at stake?
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
Of course.
Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.
And my own.
Enough!
Quite.
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
Is it awfully violent?
Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
What's that then?
Go on, child.
Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
And I in yours.
Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
You've come to lecture me?
Houdini mice.
I can't
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
To make pictures.
So I've been told.
You know that can't happen.
There's no call for that language-
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
I am not that woman.
We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.
There is nothing to discuss-
Not for me.
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from this day forth. It shall nourish us both
I can't remember the lines!
Huh?
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
Forget it-
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Please don't say this.
We're doing Hearst.
Don't do this
I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY, REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE - - REMEMBER THAT?!
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Yeah, ain't it swell?
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
Thank you-
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
Again.
Again
CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
Happy birthday.
It was fun, wasn't it?
Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
We done?
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
Where's your wife, Jake?
Nothing...
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
Yeah, she's nice.
You know, like bang her or anything?
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...
Well, that's what I mean.
When?
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
No, I just told you what happened.
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
What?
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
It feels real good.
No.
That's all right. He don't mind.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Jake...
Who asked you?
No, I'm not.
Nobody. I love you, remember?
Positive.
What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
I got bored so I went to the movies.
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
Yeah --
What?
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
Don't make no difference no more.
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
Oh. When are they expected home?
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
Namely?
What time?
Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
Oh -- I almost forgot!
Mrs. Thorwald.
You figured that out, huh?
I told you that --
Like what?
A possibility.
You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
For getting rid of that cast.
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
Why should I?
No.
How?
Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.
Lisa Fremont.
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
She pay you much?
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
You can tell that from here?
Got a shovel?
Uh-huh.
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
You mean leave the magazine?
For what?
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso.
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
Nothing, thank heaven.
Do you think I consider this recreation?
There's nothing to see.
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
Thinking about Thorwald?
That's what the witnesses told him.
Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
Thank you.
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring!  Do you ever leave yours at home?
How?
Phone number?
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
Good luck, Buzz.
Hi.
Down in back.
Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
Hold it, Jim.
We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
Well--
Sorry.
Really, Frank?  When was that?
Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
In my mother's drawer.
What?
I don't want to make friends.
I just don't want trouble.
Who knows.  Plato?
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
Wow!  Well now-there-then!
There's only one key.
Hey!  How 'bout that!
Your father!
I'm here.
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
I promise nothing'll happen if you do.  You want my jacket?  It's warm.
Just a guard.
But you didn't hurt anybody.
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
No.
What?
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
Bully for you.
Where what was.
Dig the square wardrobe!
I'm not so bad.
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
No.
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
You disappointed?
What?
It is for me too.
Talk to them!  Heavens!
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
He hates me.
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
No.
I'll never get close to anybody.
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
I didn't want to stop.
Please, Gabriel, don't...
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
No, no --
One more. Smile. One more.
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Nick, no --
Nick --
Nick, what are you --
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
Nick...
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
What?
I'm almost done.
If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
Yes!
Yes!
She says a lot of things.
I don't know.
This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
And I worked there. For a year.
Why not.
Put it on.
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
I'm gonna need some money.
Nnn... nothing...
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
No, Gabriel... no...
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.
Leave the tree.
Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.
Show's over.
I don't know... what you're...
What... Powwow...
I don't steal any --
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.
Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
Hi, Nick.
Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
How do we do that?
It's a roach, guy --
Oh, man --
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Not yet.
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Standing right here, man!
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
...for Christmas...
And you set me up.
But... I had a five...
Since when? What the hell is this room?
Fine, now.
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
Elois?
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
Pam Grier.
The Milwaukee Brewers?
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
What for?
It's a change.
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
What do you care?
Give me my book.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
You do?
And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
Nice Guy Eddie.
It's not good...
What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
Why not?
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
Where?
Where? Are they out in the car?
I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
I don't know anybody.
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
That fuckin did it!
You takin' his side?
Yeah, those guys too.
Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
Yeah.
Like sticking his nose into other people's business.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
You're not going out to look for them?
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
I suppose that's my fault.
There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
A little hot.
A man I used to know.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
Yes.
All right. I'll tell you.
How'd you happen to miss?
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --
All right, you didn't know.
Nobody asked you to.
I don't care.
That's right -- you go back to sleep. Tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different. Don't you worry about anything -- Mary's going to talk things over with your folks --
You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
I like it.
Then why stay in the hills.
Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
I don't like to see you go.
Now where's she goin'? --
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
He certainly could. About a month.
How many ways can a man say no.
I don't care what he thinks.
Put on another one.
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
Good night, Steve.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
That's the end of the line.
From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
Would they be good to eat?
You were supposed to be reading words.
But you're his brother.
Oh, sure.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
I think he wants me.
Would you die already?!
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
No, stay.
Okay.
No. I never date outside my race.
Yeah.
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.
Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
Shit!
Can you feel that?
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Then what are we going to do?
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
I think so.
What, you think I did this to myself?
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
Thanks. I made them by hand.
Made you say it!
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
Quick, everyone to the lab.
I'll go.
My child, you're alive!
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
Uh, uh.
It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.
What are you getting at, Professor?
I wouldn't go that far.
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
In about fifteen minutes.
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
Are you sure it's not the tape?
That's why we came here, remember?
Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
Second best.
What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
No, I'm fine.
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
Is there a killer loose?
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie? Listen to his call.  Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
Oohhhh, Eugene!
Ooohhhh!
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 
GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
It's not fair!!
I certainly was not!
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
We all have bad nights. 
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
Right here!
He's a good boy.
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
What's he know?
Yeah - sure.
Where?
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
Yes.
No.
It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
What sort of danger?
She could use a hundred dollars.
I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
"The Dante?"
I guess most people are.
She showed me a drawing.
I saw him on the floor. He was cut -  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him  white  and the men holding him up between them.
Yes.
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
Why wait?
But you're always at the library.
I don't think that's so revealing.
I don't know.
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
It's because of Jacqueline  I can't go on looking for her --
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
What's wrong, Mary?
I keep telling myself that.
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything  and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
I'd forgotten.
It might have.
I'd like that.
Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
You know where she is?
I don't know.
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
Thank you, my dear.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
We haven't even begun tea yet.
It won't hurt.
Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
Sister older or younger?
How do you mean?
I feel like they do.
Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
Agreed.
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
What kind of personal project?
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
Yes.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Sometimes. Afterward.
Do you want me to stop?
You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
I fantasized about you.
If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
How come?
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
Yes.
Possibly.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.
Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
Is that supposed to comfort me?
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.
Yes!
Yes.
Not very often.
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.
I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
Did you masturbate?
Did you find him attractive?
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
Why, so you can go after him?
Do you have to say that?
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
He doesn't have a phone.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
And... do whatever it is you do.
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Well, why?
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
Cynthia!
You don't know that for sure.
Did he touch you?
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
What is it?
Well. I can't stay.
Bye.
Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
Whichever you prefer.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
Yes.
Hi.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
Could be risky.
You know what I mean.
Cynthia. John.
Nothing wrong with trying.
You told Ann about this?
Look, are we going to do it or not?
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
How about for five hundred?
Really. How'd it go?
Yes?
All right, jesus.
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
Did I say anything?
It's crazy.
Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
Good!  I'm gonna be there.
Time to check with Flavors.
As Janet's parents this should be really easy.  Your last clue... Mental Instability.  You have thirty seconds.
I got it!  I got it!!!
Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
LITTLE BLACK DRESS
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
Dentonvale has been sold.
Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
Now Betty, don't overreact.
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
Shove it, Ralph!
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
Absolutely correct.
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!
Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
Flavors!
Fast!
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
You guys having fun?
Well, then put him at the singles table.
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
I'm good.
You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
Good. How're you?
Not so bad yourself.
Maybe. Recognize this?
No, we're paying for the wine.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
Oh yeah. Much better.
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
Let me call Christine.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.  This is the new one, right, Chris?
Yeah, that would be a good move.
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
If that's what feels right.
Then it's a good thing.
Pour us a couple.
You know her?
You know that chick?
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
And she likes Pinot.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Miles.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
What?
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
Bathroom.
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
We were supposed to play golf.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
What? Of course I like Christine.
Nope.
Thanks, Jack.
Nope.
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
I don't want to talk about it.
Is what the money thing?
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
What's up?
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
Quite a week.
No, I'm okay.
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
I'm fine. You rest.
Whatever. Sorry.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
The Windmill.
How long have you been into wine?
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Goodnight, Miles.
Well, nice to see you now.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
What rehearsal dinner?
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
Yeah.
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
I am.
See you over there, Miles.
Exactement!
She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
He had to make a phone call.
Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
Where?
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
It tastes old.
Only for pee or poop.
No dad!
Don't touch him.
You don't even know what that word means.
I heard them Morgan.
Who said I was going to die?
...I will.
It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
You got two minor league home run records don't you?
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
You want him coming in the house next time?
Yes, it was.
Yes.
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
Should we make a run for it out the back?
Got it!
Me too.
That means they're unemployed.
What's two?
Where are we going to sleep?
He definitely wasn't a midget.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
Yeah.
No money, eh?
What do you mean, the horses?
Sounds good.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
I'll be long gone.
You got no idea what they were after?
Where's the pinto going?
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
The other guy drew first.
He is now.
Howdy.
Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
You're kidding.
I was afraid of that.
Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
Rae, I need help.
Good luck, Mal.
I heard that too.
Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
It's been a while.
You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
I run the place. What can I get you?
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
So-called?
Who's the owner?
He left me.
What do you mean?
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
We don't need a name.  We'll cast an unknown.
Difficult.  I'm difficult.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
Even the fall from the plane.
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
You really think so?
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
No.
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
No... it's life.
Hello, is this Elaine?
It was a great show, Dad...
Because obviously she existed, right?
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Yes, call me Simone.
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please put your clothes on
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
Body double.
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
Is she here tonight?
I know plenty of boys.
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Really?  Too bad.
She did... didn't she?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up.
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
What do you want -- ?
You're in breach.
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
Taller, Viktor.
-- What you don't understand --
... digitized.
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
Goodnight, sweetheart.
Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
That's good.
How do you draw now?
Something I want?
Yes.
Dr. Crowe.
Me too.
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
Yes.
Yes, I am.
You do?
Lots of things.
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
Don't get mad.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
Standing next to my window.
They scare me too sometimes.
...I don't know.
Cole, please stop.
You're a stuttering Stanley!
You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
Stop looking at me.
It's our pleasure.
Chuck E. who?
Meaning?
Chicken blood on the crops.
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Tramp.
Not according to these.
The band.
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
Sorry.
Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
I thought you said two hundred.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
Metaphysical question, man.
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
This is his room... isn't it?
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
People say he was a murderer.
Amends...?
Not while you're driving.
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
He started it.
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Let it go.
Mmmm -- so can I...
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
I was getting 'warmed' up.
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
Us? We been... moonlighting.
I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
That's not funny.
Just checking out the lights.
Oh, yeah?
I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
He tried to kill you, Starla.
Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
We're coming your way, man!
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
Yeah.
Shut up.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
That's disrespectful.
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
Out.
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Grant, you're sick!
What other stuff?
Through a wound on his stomach?
Your what?
What do you think?
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
A what?
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
We lost him.
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
Ciao.
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
You take the front, I'll take the back.
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
The minute you see him, you'll know.
Yes.
Because they said it couldn't be done.
Redneck heaven.
Not for long, you ain't.
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
I'll believe it when I see it.
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
Where the hell are you?
Who's Fred?
If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
Wait a minute, what other agent?  What other agent?
Ww... uh...
You shot me and murdered my friends.
Damn... alright then.
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
That's not possible. I told you.
I said I got his machine.
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Without peer?
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
They what? What? No. No. Why?
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
...He does now...
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
None whatsoever.
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
You love her?
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
...What are they doin' right now...?
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
A puppet.
Didn't you talk to Snow?
In the lab.  With her, probably.
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters.  She walked into it and disappeared.  She was gone.
He's dead.
To who?
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
No.
That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
I love her.
Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
I'll go with you.
And tonight?
Rheya.  Not here.
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
What kind of look?
I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
I did too.
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
Yes.  Yes.
That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
You... she said I didn't love her.
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
Neither did I.
Who are you, then?
Yes, you are --
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
Please.  Don't.
Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
I'm not Snow.
Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
There's a phone in the car.
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
I came on at 8:00.
How did you know?
No kidding.
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
Sleep good.
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
Not exactly.
Oh God, that's great!
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
Do you dance?
Yeah.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
Claire...
What?
What are you talking about?
You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
You don't want to hear about it.
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
It's not your taste.
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
You heard me.
No.
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
Koontz!  I need you guys!
No, I need'm now!
No, sir...
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
I brought the girl.  She's outside.
Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
Mom and I got plans.
So, what are you doing tonight?
Shooting?
Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
Let me see.
No. No, that's okay.
Nonot really.
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
Harry
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
Well...
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
What if you get hurt?
Thank God.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
Do you mind if I come too?
Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
Why?
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
Precise equipment such as waldos
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
I will finish what I've begun
I heard about Thorkel's order--
Really, Professor, I--
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
Like it?
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
Plenty.
Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
So long, Sefton.
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
That's right.
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
Okay, Security -- what happened?
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Which one of you is what?
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
Not you.
Yeah.
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
Raus! Raus! All of you!
It's a mouse trap.
Why do you do this to me every morning?
They'll shoot you, Animal!
It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
So what? There's other women!
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
It's not good for you, Animal.
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
Let me alone.
Animal! Animal! Wake up!
You want to go?
Anything else?
Yes, sir.
Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
You starting that again?
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
Shoot!
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Thirty-fifth.
Are you questioning me?
Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
What time?
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
Yes, you do!
Talk what? I do not know anything!
Not particularly.
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
Oh! Somebody was peeking!
He is.
Twelve years, sir.
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
I have to find a way to get to Soran.
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
Agreed.
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
The station complement was nineteen.
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
Beam them directly to Sickbay.
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
You're in the Nexus.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
Yes, where would you go?
I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.
I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
It's our pleasure.
Oh, of course.
Yes, yes, it is.
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
I hadn't planned on it.
That's right.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
Phasing? To where?
I thought you might.
Where are the deflector relays?
Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
No, I didn't know that.
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
Trilithium?
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
Nothing. As before.
Aye, sir.
What did you see, Chekov?
Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
David... Sorry I'm late.
David!... What went wrong?
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
Underground deposit?
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
And Spock with it. They are joined together.
... How long?
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
I'll go...
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
Yes. And I know you.
The ship... Out of danger...?
She's to be decommissioned.
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
Go, Sulu!
Genesis?! Whatever for?
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
Report status!
All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
... The needs of the few...
... Spock...
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
Success, my lord.
They outnumber us, my Lord --


How is that...?
All true.
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
Maybe...
But we can't just sit here -- !
You know what she'll say...
What's the matter -- ?
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
Let them eat static.
Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
Visual --
Inoperative.
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
A few shots, sir.
Spock?
Admiral --
Give the word, Admiral.
Admiral, this is Spock.
The word is given: warp speed.
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
To be sure, Captain.
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
How far?
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
The power of creation --
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
Best we could do in two hours.
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
The ship -- out of danger?
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
You earned it.
Take the test again.
HURRY.
The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
Honors -- hup!
No power to the weapons system, sir.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
Where must you go?
Just a couple of kooks...
A moment alone, please.
Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
We've done it before.
-- That's the general idea.
Cramps.
Come on, Pavel...
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
... My God...
... Best shot...?
We're just -- observing.
Reading the patient's vital signs.
Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
Sir, heat shields at maximum!
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
Is there something wrong with the one I have?
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.
Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
Implicitly.
... You're very perceptive.
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
You want the details?
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
Kirk. They're gone.
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
... You have a point...
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Why does it have to be goodbye?
Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
In progress, Admiral.
What is our target in time?
What are the variables...?
You've programmed that from memory...?
Yes.
The tank will be finished by morning...
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
Right.  Will you help us?
... Aye sir...?
Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
On speakers.
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure.
Mr. Sulu?
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
On my way...!
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
Arigato. Sayonara.  Thank you, honorable sir.
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice...  Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...
This way!
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
You're what?
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
The Ba'ku.
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
May I talk to you alone?
Eject the core.
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...
You've not aged a day since then?
Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
Transferring controls to manual.
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
Say the greeting again...
No children?
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
Or you could try lying down.
... I believe you...
I look forward to reading your report.
Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --
I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
I do not know what you are referring to.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
Ready quantum torpedo.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
How serious is the damage?
There should be some kind of manual release...
If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings.  It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.
This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
I'm on it...
Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
Ready.
Great name. French?
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
I can try.
You're lying.
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
Some.
No. It's a lot further than that.
No... I'm from France.
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Aye, sir.
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
Go to manual.
Onscreen.
Worf... torpedo... now!
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
Where the hell are they going?
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
Riker here.
Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?
Vulcans sleep lying down...
We DO sleep lying down.
We've been set up all along.
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
Don't remind me.
Come on...
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
I beg your pardon?
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
I am.
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
But if she's cloaked...
Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...
ALL uniforms?
He's got it.
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
There's gotta be a way out of this place...
Right -
Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
Sulu!
I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
He was just about to explain the whole damn -
So, that's it..
You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
Not yet... Section 4236...
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
... is to trust him.
What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
Nevertheless.
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
Aye, aye, sir.
What exactly does that mean?
At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
How long is that?
It'll serve you right.
Can you describe it, Deanna?
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
That was another time.
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
I can see that.
Sorry, sir.
Good work. The download?
It would appear so.
Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Fire!
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
Do you have a name, sir?
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
You're speaking of emotional investment?
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
I know how he thinks.
Make it so.
I can feel your desire, Deanna.
And that's exactly what he's going to do.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
Not yet, Mister Worf.
On screen.
On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.
Counselor?
Can anything be done for him?
She's the most beautiful ship Ive ever seen.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
No?
Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
In time.
Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
Long ago.
I am.
Should I raise shields?
Let's go.
Yes, Praetor.
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
They're holding position.
You don't have to understand.
How much are your rooms?
Fill this out.  Will this be cash or credit card?
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
They must have picked it up in space.
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
It's taken on a disguise.
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
You're not hearing me.
Shermin!! Shermin!!!
Okay...
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
Marc Shermin.
Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever...
Dashboard.
Pancakes.
Smile.
I am Jenny Haydn.
Horses.
Music.
I do not understand.
Yes. Day... night.
We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
I don't understand 'friend.'
I am your friend.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
Come on.
I feel better if I move.
I can't stay on this planet.
Nothing.
Horses.
No.
I understand.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
You want the baby to laugh at me.
Many, many days and nights...
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
You could have killed us both!!
Call the police!!
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
My grandmother's rich.
In the cars, too?!
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
Doesn't make sense.
You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
People have made mistakes in these situations before.
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
What's all this squid shit?
Leave him alone, Tran.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
You're going down.
I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
No, Lenny.
Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
Yeah.  No, not really.
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
But this is a bad one.
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.
Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
Only way I could stand your ties.
Where's Faith?
Jesus!
That's pretty much the way it happened.
That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...
Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
Faith, can I talk to you a second?
I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
Fumitsu.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
No idea.
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
So that gives you something.
It's not your fault.
So the guy's not a sicko.
Sure.
OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
Jesus, Mace!
It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
You sure?
I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
Well, look at the plus side.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
How long does it last?  Oh.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
Uh unh.
Then we'll be right where we are now.
Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
What do you want from me?
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
What about his killer?
At the field office.
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
This better be important.
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
They like my stories. They like the way I think. They're into fantasy. I turn them on.
I don't believe this.
Collected shoes too?
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
I didn't use Low's name.
Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
The man knew how to dress.
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
They're all criminals?
And one other thing.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
What did you tell him?
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
You did.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
Oh.
What's that?
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
And you're working with him?
Does one exist?
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
Kulok.
Yes, sir.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
Who told you about her?
Yeah.
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
So you're the new meat?
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
Murman!
Shit.
It didn't feel that way.
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
Could you believe it?
You want this in black chips.
Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.
No...
Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
I would love to see you again sometime.
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
...The red piece of shit over there...
Right.
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
What's the point?
Oh boy.
Well, that's dumb.
Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.
So, what? Eleven?
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is... 
I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike. 
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
Hang on, Voltaire.
I don't know...
What Vegas?
Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
She smiled baby.
Did she, or did she not smile?
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
Thanks for clarifying that.
Let's just leave.
Did she, or did she not smile.
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
No, baby. You're money.
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
See? And what does this guy she's with do?
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
It starts at eight...
It's on.
What?
What a surprise.
No, baby!
No...
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
You could make their heads bleed, though.
No.
...double diamond...
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
America has been good to me...
Go back to your house and wait for me...
You have to answer for Santino.
I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
Your girl friend.  She says she can't make it tonight.  You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. I'll kill you, you bastard!
I'm not hungry yet.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
The gun will be there.
We gotta move...
How bad will it be?
No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
Sure.
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
Are you worried about security for your million?
Sure.
You understand him better than anyone.
On a day like this.  Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait.
Should I bring him in.
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.
Tom said he'd take care of it.
For killing a man.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore.  I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.
Shhhhh.
Come Sunday morning:  My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.
You look good, too.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
And when they shot me father...
Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny will never get that part because I hate that pinko punk and I'm going to run him out of the Movies.  And I'll tell you why.  He ruined one of Woltz Brothers' most valuable proteges.  For five years I had this girl under training; singing lessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing lessons!  We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars--I was going to make her a star.  I'll be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it wasn't all dollars and cents.  That girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass I've ever ad and I've had them all over the world.  Then Johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off.  She threw it all away to make me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!
No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
Have you agreed on a meeting?
They're waiting to see my father.
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
Who is he?
Michael...
Michael, I love you.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Wake me up when you come to bed?
Until the old man tells me different.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
What are you, inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
I do renounce him.
Just be patient.
Be patient.
The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
You're unlucky.
What are you doing in Mongi?
Sure. Any time.
You just woke up!
Well, we ate everything without you.
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
That's funny.
Can you mix a martini?
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
What?
Your parents met her.
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
I played piano in a few places.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
No! I've got more than one shirt!
Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
What club?
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
Is Freddie here?
That's good.
What?
So tell me.
Marge and I are getting married.
How?
I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
I think it might hurt her to know.
Where's Mr MacCarron?
I just don't believe that!
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
Frances?
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
Where's Dickie?
Ha. Did he say why?
Dickie did it.
Hello Marge!
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
To the manner born.
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
Why? When?
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
Do you know Tom?
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
Is Freddie in Rome?
Hello Meredith.
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
Where have you been since then?
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
Thanks.
I can't later.
Ten thirty?
Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you.
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Well that would be even better gossip.
I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
Postmortem?
Even your fiance...?
No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat.
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
Huh?
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. 
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
I can believe that.
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.
No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
Oh. Who was that again?
Keep it.
Hello, Betsy.
Yeah.
With who?
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
This is gotta be a game, right?
With the other hand, right?
Show me how he did that again.
Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
Awh, come off it, Pal.
What did you do?
A real skunk.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
In the jungle. 122nd.
You carry a piece? You need one?
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
That's what you think.
Oh, come off it, man.
Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
Pittsburgh.
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
He looks like a killer.
He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
Besides, I've got to stay here.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here.  Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog!
Damn straight.
No Sir.
How's your driving record?
You moonlightin?
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. There's always opening on one fleet or another.  Fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. You gotta phone?
Why do you ask?
Why?
What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
You would, huh?
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.  Got that?
Shit.
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
Neither do I, I guess.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
Now they only have three rockets left.
Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
What's that?  Mason?
Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
And  I love you, Pete!
You mean,  me?
Why me?
And why not?
Yes.  Hic!
Oh...
What?
Oh.
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
I... I need a drink of water.
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
Well, son, you're home!
By all means.
Shhhhhh.
The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
Good to meet you.  Again.
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
Ah.
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
Yes?
Oh, no, I...
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
Pete...
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
Wish I could say the same thing.
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
Aren't you coming?
Can we get him to the hospital?
Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
I... I don't believe this.
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
I was decorated.
So, it is a blacklist.
Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
And I won't be a communist anymore.
That's not the country Luke fought for.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
When was that?
Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me.
Yeah... me too.
Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
The customers?  I don't know...
Oh.
What exactly did you hear?
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
I already have.
No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
No, not really.
Yes, I did.
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
All right. 
What do you mean?
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
She already has a daughter.
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
Then go.
If your father were here...
Take them.
Yes?
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie. 
Yep.
Right across the bay there.
Yes?
That's where the Brenners live.
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
It's nothing.
Impossible.
What happened?
No. Here's fine. 
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
I told you. We met yesterday.
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
Shhh. Shhh.
I know you can.  But I'd like to.
If they are?
Oh, thank you.
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
Would you like me to go for her?
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? Ain't much we can do about it. 
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
That's all right.
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
We met in court.
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
Famished.
His wife changed the channel.
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
I don't give a damn what you believe!
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
No, I have my things in the car.
Certainly, of birds.
Growing a beard...
Well, they'll go along with anything.
Take wing!
I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
The bay doesn't.
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
How about you?
I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
No... wait.  Hold me.
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
Yes.
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
Well, all right, but...
Maybe! Is it impossible?
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
How?
...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
Can't you please finish your drink?
But can't you give me any idea?
Good morning.
I want you to help my little girl.
Yes.
It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
Aye.
I've heard of it.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
Well? And are you not a good student?
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
Gray killed her.
Pulse?
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
No.
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
What?
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
They'll be thinking of that, too.
You've no thought of going there?
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
No.
It was a woman when we put her in.
Not yet.
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
Don't call me that confounded name.
I am the best man for the job.
Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.  Say that you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here.
Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
I take no gifts from you.
I've drunk enough tonight.
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
I come from Lisbon.
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
I think we should get some support?
Where the fuck did you come from?
You're the guy killed Dutton.
I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
No! Why are you haunting me?
Yes I do, I really do.
I don't want to see!
So you're going to kill him?
It's not. I can't take it.
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
I know the guy leaves a sign.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
That was my first question.
Yes -- that is true.
No -- not at all.
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
I assure you such power exists.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
What do you mean, dear?
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Where is that?
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
All right.
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
Why not, Bobby?
Mr. Brady's a cop.
Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
I can judge only by what I see.
Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
Come on in.
Is that what you're thinking about?
I don't care about the rest of the world!
I'm not going to marry anybody.
What time is it?
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
Where is the meeting going to be?
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
Remember those words.
You mean he has the power of life and death?
I'd give you a very good price.
It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know.
No -- I'm afraid not.
How long will that take?
It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
Yeah.
El Vampiro.
Maximum body-count.
Honda 250, huh?
What's goin' on, Marko?
You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
For a ride.
No.  Stick around.
Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
I told Max eight o'clock.
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
Did we have a date tonight?
Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
Mom... please.
Can't.  Got plans of my own.
He's already gone to bed.
In here?
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
I hear this is the decade for cute.
Yeah.  I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom.  I just want to be your friend.
Okay.
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
So do I!
I was here first.
Nowhere.
No.  Why?
Piss off.
Don't turn on the light.
Nanook...
The Marines.
Let's load 'em.
No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
Yeah.
Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
Maybe.
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
Finish what?
... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
Have you come across Fuchs?
Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
If it did get to him.
Look, I'm just guessing...
I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
You buy any of this, Blair?
That's good enough.
What for?
We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
Nothing we can do about that.
In this weather?
After all this mess.
That far?
What's that?
No.
Don't let up, Childs!
I am going after them.
Can you think of any other tests?
I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
It's the generator I think!  No power.
MacReady...?
The journey is part of my work.
I'm so sorry, Kalen.
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
This is it?
Can you show us where they live?
It frightens you.
Oh, shut up.
The Morlocks didn't build this.
No...
Vox...
I won't leave you like this.
I'll never forget this.
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
As slaves.
How do you control the Morlocks?
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
No...
No...
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
Got here as soon as I could.
You know I can't.
I need... to talk to you.
Not here... alone.  Please.
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
Oh?
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
I don't understand.
You're not from beyond the valley.
You can see so many here.
Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
Thank you.
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
What are you?
Someone you loved very much.
I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
Imagine that.
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
Then don't.
Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of.
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
I never touched your father! I swear!
They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
No, it hasn't.
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Why?
You two ok?
Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
Yeah.
After I...
If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
I know.
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
They're not.
To the hospital.
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
Then, where are you going?
Good. How's your mom?
I'm doing fine.
I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
I guess I'd ask you why.
So it's helping?
You thought my father was crazy?
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
You have no idea what's going on.
It doesn't look all that different.
No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me.
How...how do you know?
I did?
Don't you go to jail for that?
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
Where are you going?
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
So you never knew your mother?
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
Uh-huh.
No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
In the leg.
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
You girls are in some hot water.
Louise, I'll do anything.  I know what's makin' you run.  I know what happened to you in Texas.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
A .38.
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her?
It don't matter.  Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
What's wrong?
What for?
Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.
That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Maybe.
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
Why now, Jimmy?
Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
You wanna let me see your license, please?
In the back?
Am I in trouble?
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
Just what is that supposed to mean?
So this is all my fault, is it.
Give me the keys.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
She thinks he's a pig.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on.
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
Alright, Louise!
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
You know those little dogs you see people with?
We should have just ignored him.
Thelma!
Okay, Louise... It's okay.
Sorry!
I believe you.
Yes.
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
What do you mean?
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
We can change our names.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
How do you stay so positive?
We're not giving up, Thelma.
You got that right.
Fuck you.
Hi there!  You alright?
Grrrreat!
Jeez, I didn't catch it.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
He implied it.
Good-looking?
Loser? You?
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
Huh? But why did Healy?
Yeah feels like it.
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
No.
Jesus Christ you're right.
Call you back.
Big time.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
No I can't.
Am I?
Yep.
I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
Ahh.
You own a home there?
Pat Healy.
Here you go.  What's that smell?
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
Deco.
-- Love story of our time.
Huh... that's strange.
You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
Uh-huh.
No.
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
No, not at all.
So she's married?
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
I said buttplug. She's heinous.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
Four.
I never said that.
That must make it tough.
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Where would I have seen your work?
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
I appreciate you looking out for me.
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
Hi, Mary.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Oh yeah.
Who's that?
He's dead.
Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Mary, come on...
Really?
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
I wish.
You got what stuck?
I wasn't trying --
Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
Bye, Ted.
We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
What are you doing?
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
Then they should speak up.
Yeah.
This is from the Highest Authority?
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Forget it, Scotty.
Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
No way.
I don't know. I don't know.
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
I'm gonna protect those pilots.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.
Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
Sioux Indian, right?
It ain't Geronimo.
Good. Thank you.
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
-- did you understand me when I said that --
His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.
Seven.
You crashed my file?
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
Good.
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
A long way from home. You be careful out there.
Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.
Thanks, Cooch.
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
-- Leo wasn't killed here. He was dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling wire.
Bullshit.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.
She's your sister?
-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
What you call myths, we call our history.
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.
Well, it was just a dream, I --
What do you mean?
Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
You didn't have another vision...
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
Move it, Magdelana.
NO.  My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Go ahead, Ray.
Leavenworth a tough joint?
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there?
Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
Well, it is. It is that, too.
I could be, too.
I'm with someone.
Yeow!
How did you know this was my car?
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
Two miles.
You know. The finger.
You let me make a fool of myself.
You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.
For what?
Um. You.
Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
The what?
Uh hum.
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
It's not suffering anymore.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
It's just as I thought.
I'm still second best.
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
What?
That's what I want.
I like to play "reality".
How does it go?
What truth?
That's three.
Your watch.
How could you?
...Something like that.
No sir! But you have to be ready.
Remember one thing.
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
YEAH, COUGAR?
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
What is he doing?
He better be kidding!
Saving them some paperwork.
Not anymore.
Okay.
Like what?
Who's your pilot?
So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.
Hey, see any controls back there?  And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!
Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
What?
I've had enough...for now.
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
Was.
Well, you'll just have to make do with him .
I didn't ruin her.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
Tell me one thing.
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
Three guesses.
What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.
Didn't everybody?
I talked a man back once. Three months later, we lost him. It's his decision. Only he knows.
Me?
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
I know. I was there.
I know.
He was by the book, all the way.
I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
What was that?  An accident?
Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
No, sir.
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
It's not my fault.  We hit a memory cap.
Eight years.
Hetero.
Sleazy...and demure.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
O.K., everybody pull out!
Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
Oh, Rekall.
"RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.
Harry!
What is it?
Drive!  DRIVE!!
Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
Lori, move.
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
You went to those brain butchers?!
It was implanted by the Agency.
I didn't know you were so kinky.
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
Doug, don't!
Nice to meet you.
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
What are you talking about?
I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
The one in the mine!
Aliens built it.
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
Ready as we'll ever be.
No problem.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
Cannon fuse.
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?
I'd go for penetration.  The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
Hell you did.  Your turn.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
Well, sure.
In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
That's the plan.
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
Great.  Thank you.
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
We got a plan!
Like hell you are.
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
What?
She wants to lay down.  I'm a little worried.
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.
Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
Why do you all keep asking me?
I know about Esparza.
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
No it is not, Mr. Dowd.
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
Let go of my hair.
Where's the nearest hospital?
Complain to the Bar Commission.
Sustained.
I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
Let's snuff this lowlife!
No further questions.
Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...!
Right. You're right.
Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
Eddie... I don't know about this...
George is a fucking burnout case. I didn't want him on the stand anyway. Get more names from Billy.
-- Roger -- ?
Christ... Shu is innocent.
Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right!
...For ten years, now.
-- Me? Neither.
Neither.
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
A number of them are dead, three are in prison, one's a waiter... Two -- you'll enjoy this -- two are actually members of the Chamber of Commerce.
You don't drink "booze".
Nothing has. But that's all changing.
Exactly what happened then?
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
You tell me, man.
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
See-cil.
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
I always t-tell the truth.  That's why I'm here.
No, s-sir.
Argumentative.
We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
-- Eddie told you?
-- What trial?
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
That's right.
And you b-believe that.
Blonde.
I want you.
Here he comes.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
What was?
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
Bobby...
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Thank you, Carl.
I am going over here.
Did she have someone with her?
Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.
COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED. GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW.
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
Anything else?
And neither will I.
No, sir, we did not.
Someone else has it now.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Did she ever mention any friends?
She only worked here a month. Nice girl. Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem with --
Thanks.
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
When?
He probably wanted to drive over.
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
No.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
Maybe.
Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
James...
Not now.
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
Hiking?
Fish eyes?
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
But my name isn't Leland Palmer.
We're late to get to your mother.
Yes.
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
Nothing.
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
Yes.
'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
No.
Nothing further, your Honor.
I'll rule on that presently.  Proceed.
...I was one of a group of...
Tell me one?
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years.  Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
It was good of you to meet...
That's what I'd planned to...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
There's nothing they can do to me.
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Why is that?
'Code Blue'...
Yes. I wrote it.
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
Right. Who called?
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
Hi. How are you doing?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
I did.
Yes.
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
My client can't walk, your Honor.
...things change.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
Thank you for seeing me.
That happens.
Ready, your Honor.
Mr. Concannon...?
Overruled...
And what are you? A cop?
I think I will.
We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some, uh... I have some work to do...
I've got to work.
Isn't there something you...
And what makes you so tough?
If I don't 'grow up...'
What is that to you...?
I have to talk to you.
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
Let me talk to Mickey.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
From the magazine?
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
It's locked.
...I'm sure you do...
I'm going to see you get that chance.
Yes.
He's not in, Sir.
He's... you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.  He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...'  Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
What do you want?
...I'm going to need your help...
Oh shit, what's today?
Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
I'm swell.
I think we tried that. The case is over.
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
You saw Kat in New York...  ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
Yes.
As I've said we had some more...
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
All right - I've seen enough!
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
How can you say that when you don't know him!
I didn't know how to stop you...!
They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.
Would you like some coffee, General?
Can you handle one of these?
It's gone now.
I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.
It was...  ...one of them!
It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down.
If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
It's always been a good persuader.
I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  You're still in command.  Clayton Forrester!  I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
We sell the tamales, enchiladas - hot dogs!
Welcome to California!
We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
I'm sure we can match any offer.
No biggie, really.
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
Chase. Hi...
Chase, you'd better come home.
What?  What kind of episode?
No...
He was just here!
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
He sleepwalks, you idiot!  He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.  Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...
Say how they find their way back home.
No.  Tonight.  It's important!
They were safe and could sleep.
You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
Steady...
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!
Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
What are you talking about?
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
Choice?  What kind of choice?
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
Black's fine.
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
Guilty.
I can take it.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Yes, Sir.
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
I didn't know sir.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Yes sir.
Okay.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
What?
Believe what?
Because it looks good.
Shut up, Phil.
Like this!
What's the difference?
Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
They don't know that.  We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  I'm a kid.
I know you will.
I can't watch this.
I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
My dad.
Unfurl the squares!
Face what?
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
He killed the dolphin.
Of what?
They have every right Chuck.
So is violating international law.
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
Twice.
No.
Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.
This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
I should be eating with the crew.
She's Cuban.
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
Shut up donut.
Like you'd know what to do with one.
I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
I figured it out.
Look, save it for somebody else will ya.  This ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
What?
You've gotta be kidding?
Son of a bitch!!
The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
I'm sorry...
I can't.
Aaauuuhhh!!!
Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
... Absolutely not.
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
Why? He's right in the groove.
Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
This be it?
No way... GET OUT!!!
Ready for another?
What's that?
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
Set one up.
Muchas gracias.
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
Yes, that's so. But there is not much to destroy.
Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!!
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
That bastard Pucinski...
Peanut...
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
No, he picked me up.
And you never told nobody about it?
That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
What happened to him?
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
Hell, peanut...
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
It's just another case, Sailor.
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
Yeah, I'm here.
No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
And Bobby too, I hear...
Oughta make 'em happy.
Went with Bobby.
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
That was in Vietnam.
Shake hands with your daddy.
Damn!
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
Yes.
See! I knew you had it all under control.
You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
What?
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
No.
Whattya mean?
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
He's right, you look horrible.
Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
Hit your brakes.
Where would we go?
Tripp, where the hell...
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
Find the jacket.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
And your wife left you.
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.
'Fraid so.
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
Yea?
No! What gave you that idea?
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.
So I'm told.
Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
Miss Sloviak's.
She is. Ah. Here we go...
Is he all right?
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
Hm.
Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
Hm.
No.
Amazing.
How can you tell?
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
The hell I am.
I never said that.
I didn't mean it that way.
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
I don't know... 'Episodes.'
Okay.
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
Just checking.
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
Oh. Well. I...
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
Chancellor.
I got the message you called too.
Simple.
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
I heard.
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
James Leer.
I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
Inside.
It didn't come up.
Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
I might have his number on campus.
No, I'm going ho --
I haven't heard of half of those.
You want to keep him happy.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
Something wrong with that?
When can I see her?
Huh?
When?
Isn't it?
Sure.
The mother sure has her hands full.
It's hard to describe.
It's a bright sound.
It's my bird book.
I have no idea.
Got something to hide?
Who said I wanted to buy it?
You going to take me on a nature walk?
I fell asleep.
Woodsman?
I don't know.
Little Red Riding Hood.
Know what?
I was asleep.
I could take you downtown.
Apartment's okay.
Yeah.
If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
Can I ask how old you are?
No you're not.
How come?
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
Does he?
Do you like it when he asks you?
What will happen if I do?
Your daddy will always love you.
I know because... it's just something I know.
Robin, listen to me.
Yes?
I said the job is okay.
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
Ev-i-dence.
Reflect.
I'm still thinking about it.
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
I'm not that crazy.
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
We have a few more minutes.
What did you want to happen?
Is this the first one?
What?
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
All right.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
Accept you?
Are you okay?
I'm all right.
People without cars.
Neither do you.
What?
Yeah, they could.
What?
Hi.
How many girls did you molest?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
Walter.
You don't really --
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
Which brother did this?
You must hate your brothers.
I'm not scared.
Live together.
Just think about it.
You're such an asshole.
Yeah.
Not when they fly.
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
No way that could just be seawater.
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
How deep's the drop-off here?
Hey, you okay?
Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
Your rig?
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
That must be it.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
No.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
Cute, Virgil.
I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
Lindsey!  Wait a second--
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
What's the plan?
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
God, I hate that bitch.
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
Why bring it here?
That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
Yuh?
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
Just checking is out, huh?  How come?
How many are there?
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
What's you depth, Cab Three?
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
Wait for what?
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
Four or five days.
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
At what?
Then why don't we go up and see the ruins?
Maybe you'd better ask him.
How should I be ... arrogant?
Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
Yes, maybe that is better.
I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
Are you joking?
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
And why did you drop them?
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
What! Get married?
As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square.
Okay. In a few minutes.
Why?
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
It was futile. We went all over.
You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
To the shark.
It couldn't be any clearer.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.
What is it?
I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
They told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... In other words, things of that sort.
Ah, no... For me, love comes first. I'm a man, and I know what's what: first love, and then music.
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
Yes, we will.
Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
Is that possible?
Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.
Through someone else?
You've got to eat something Agnes.
Why?
Yes Mother.
No.
I don't know... I don't know...
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Love.
Oh, yes!
Do you remember the night they said it came?
Where?
And then what?
Agnes...
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Anything.
Martha Louise Livingston.
Not at the moment, no.
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
I don't know.
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
Yes.
Because I don't want one.
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
I'm not sick.
She can.
She...
Yes.
She says my whole body's a mistake.
I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...
Yes.
What do you feel?
I don't know which one 
Go away, I don't want you here.
And the passage to the barn?
Why?
How did she know about him?
Where?
Agnes... Agnes...
Agnes, who did this to you?
Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
What?
Sister...
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
When?
Who are you?
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
Uh huh.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
I haven't a clue.
Obviously there was.
The science of psychiatry.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
And in your eyes?
And what happened?
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
There's another choice.
Aquittal.
Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
Oh, some time in January.
Nothing.
Yes.
Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
I knew that after the fact.
I'd like yours too.
Nothing...
And what has that to do with it?
I'd love one.
Right...
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Listen to her singing.
Begin what?
You're what?
Who is he?
Well give me a reasonable explanation
You're saying God did it?
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
Is it because she's a nun?
I didn't guess until it was too late.
I don't know... too late to stop it.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
What happened to the baby?
Wasn't it!
Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
Bet you're only eight and a half.
Yeah?
Yeah.
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
Spoil sport!
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
You do - repeatedly.
Ta.
It is, y'know.
No, straight up.
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
He's sulking again.
I'll look in here again.
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
You can learn from books.
Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
I'm going parading before it's too late!
What?
Have they?
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...
Can't he? He's done it, son!
Come on speedy!
You wouldn't!
Hi, our lot!
Now, look here, Norm ...
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
Someone put it on me.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Oh, down the ... er ...?
That's too easy for Lennon.
But John hasn't got any.
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
A proper Aborigine.
Cattle ranch!
Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
... I don't know...
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
Dell, plot our location.
Where the hell are we?
Yeah.  Two hours.
Point eight six.  We can walk on it.
There are no commercial lanes out here.  Face it, we're out of range.
God I'm hungry.
I think that's a pretty reasonable request.
Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt.  Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.
Has the hull been breached?
Hard to say.
Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.
Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here.
The water will still recycle.
Damn it!  How long to fix?
Right. 
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
Careful, don't get under it!
What do you mean?
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
Still unconscious?
I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
Good!  That's good!
Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 
I can't, the acid will pour out!
Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
Hey!  what about the film?
It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
We sure need this flamethrower.
And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.
You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.
Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!
Feast your eyes.
You lead.
Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
Room by room, corridor by corridor.
Yeah?
Right.  Fire up all systems.
Sandy, contact traffic control.
Turn on navigation lights.
Any microorganisms?
I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
Good.
They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
Even simple.
Can we get to him?
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
Yeah... I forgot.
Who gets the privilege?
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
What can I do?
Wait a minute.
Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
Yep...
We're what!?
Too many.
What?  What's wrong?  What is it?
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
Yeah?
What?
What?
What's wrong?
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
Couple more seconds!
How tight are these shafts?
Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
You've checked that end?
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Only six?
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
Check out the tent.
Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
Please do.
Yes. I do.
Yes. The Shubert.
Just some coffee.
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
You have no right to say such things!
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
I don't know what I take you for anything...
What of it?
Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play...
And too many of them are produced.
You were there? At the play - last night?
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
Of course I knew.
Frankly, I don't remember.
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Everything... everything's so funny...
Thank you so much.
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
That I am...
Sing it?
I get a party, don't I?
See you...
To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve?
I thought you were going to be late-
I had no idea you were even here.
I can always get a fresh one. Karen - you're a Gibson girl...
What's all over?
You wouldn't understand.  How was Miss Caswell?
Now don't get carried away-
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
I'll say.
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.
I just wondered.
Of course not.
I'm for it.
When I told you what every young actress should know.
You're quite a girl.
Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
No thanks, Birdie.
I know. She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo.
But she just got here...
They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
See you home...
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
Well?
Oh-oh.
No.
I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
You were just looking around...
Probably not.
Oh, no...
It couldn't possibly interest you.
Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
There can't be very much-
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
Something most important you can do.
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
Of course it is.
Well - if I'm not in the way...
Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors...
They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
Really, Eve? Why?
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
Roughly ten minutes.
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
Isn't that what they always say?
Don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks. After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank...
With tears.
You'll be there, won't you.
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
That was a pity...
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
... Among so many quiet qualities.
Where is she?
I will.
The play? All right, I guess...
Twentyish. It isn't important.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
I just played it.
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
How about me what?
I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
Answer my question!
It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
I lived here all my life, I got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops.
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
--see?--
Why didn't we get that?
For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
You're not a kid anymore.
It's safe, try it, you'll see.
Nixon.
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
--I know, I know--
--shit, who do we know?--
--has he got an ax?--
So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
If he self-destructed.
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
Maybe we are...
--and the FBI confirms--what more do you need?--
Hmm?
Only everything...
--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
This?  Naw...
--Howard Hunt?
I'm so glad.
I told you, he had to go out on a case.
I know where Dwight works.
When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
--yes--
--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
--Deep Throat?--
--what?--
Nobody's perfect.  I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
--right, right, I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
I have nothing more to say.
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
...check...?
To where?
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
Ratfucking.
Who?--be specific. How high up?
The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
Did you change cabs?  It didn't work, something moved there--
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
Mitchell knew then.
Security consultant.
No.
I couldn't say.
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
Lotsa hints--
I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"
--remember Toronto, Harry.
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee."
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
When so ordered.
Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.
A girl. Melissa.
Of course--everything they asked--
Sure.
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
Pardon me?
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
Yep.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
Because I want to.
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Sure.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
Of course.
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
Then what the hell are you talking about?
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
Yeah, that's right.
Uh...
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
You fuckin' rule!
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
Dad, come in.
Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
Highly, highly overrated.
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
Well, this one time?  At band camp? We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it?  But it's called spin the bottle?  And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips?  And...
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
So do I, Kev.
I thought so.
Well...uh...
No, no, I'm not done!  I've got reserves!  Nadia, please please please.  I'm begging you.
I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
God dammit, Stifler!
This just got a hell of a lot better.
You think so?
I think "shithead" really says it.
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
I love you.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Ready for what?
Qualify for what?
Stifler!!
Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me.
I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
No shit.
Yep.
Thanks.
Yeah. Apparently.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
What?
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
You must get out of here. It's not safe.
It's okay. I can see fine.
I'll be right back. Stay put.
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
Fuck me...
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
Andy...
You on drugs? Huh?
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin...
Or else what? You'll kill me?
If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
Oh shit... No...
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
Yeah?
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
That's McDermott, but yeah.
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?
Allo?
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
He says -
Double merde.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Well, I don't have any money . . .
You must have.
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
Sad?
Don't be
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
It worked in Odessa...
Remove him at once.
Young	man, I...
And tell me that she's happy.
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
Yes.
Why not?
that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
Get him!
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
Hey, that was last year.
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
Nice car.
Huh? Oh... yeah.
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Yeah, my grammy.
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
Right. Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, some of her poems seem - neat, you know.
Neat, yeah.
Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
No, so help me.
It's terrific.
Okay.
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
Good? I was-
No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
Yeah?
Yeah?
M'hm.
M'hm.
U-huh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I have a tiny apartment.
Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
Let's just do it, all right?
C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
Following is different. I was spying.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?
M'hm.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
There's a spider in the bathroom.
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
It's for my complexion.
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
Oh! My God! 
Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
Remember that day?
Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
Step up here!
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
Why are you so hostile?
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
What are you depressed about?
Trigger.
May I see your license, please?
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
We can show her the schoolyard.
Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
And... uh-
We're gonna operate together.
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
His wife has diabetes!
Who's persecuting? She stole!
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
Then there was Jerry, the actor.
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
We really had a good time.
Oh, yes, yes.
I just have time to get the, uh-
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
I was a great beauty.
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
Absolutely not.
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
No, what?
Leo?
It's alright, isn't it?
It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once.
What?
Didn't I say?
Borrow whatever you like.
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.
I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.
I love her too, Joe.
Count on it.
Fuck you.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Sally?
I love you, Joe Therrian.
She left a note.
Monica.
Excuse me?
Nice to meet you.
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
Fantastic.  Out here.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
There's still time to undo this.
Did he promise?
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
I'm going to throw up.
Really?
And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
Well he can't have gone far.
He'll find his way back.
Or shitty!!  Otis!!
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
Otis!
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
It's a novel.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
Don't do this.
You changed your mind.
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
Okay.
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
I meant Sally.
You're an interior decorator, right?
Hm.
Lemon.
I think he's really angry with me too.
Sorry?
Not good.
They're nothing like us.
I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry.  Ryan, you're a great man.
Excuse me?
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
How long ago was it?
Oh?
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Do Peter Sellers again.
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
If he were still alive, maybe.
Not enough.
Oh great.
You don't know she's a bitch.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
I wasn't finished.
What does that mean?
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
I'm worried about your Galiano.
Thanks.
You don't need to thank me.
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
I don't mind...
I hope they're watercolors!
Would you like to meet my husband?
Yes.
Neither does Joe.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
Invisible!
Well...  I declared war!
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
You -- you think I'm right?
Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.
How should <u>I know</u>?
Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
You held onto this all that time?
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
Superior numbers, kid!
Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
Don't get all sappy about it!
Barbatus?
I wonder...what...was it all...for...
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
Oh, no, sir!
Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
I'll be back.
I can't think of any.
Well, I have some paper towels --
Oh!
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
Would you like to?
Yeah.
How is your cold?
How come?
No -- I like it.
The mirror -- it's broken.
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
Gin.
Was he really upset when you told him?
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
You bet. I got a terrific hand.
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
A what?
In the knee?
So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
Oh.
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
That's very wise.
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
Yes, sir.
What kind of joint are you running?
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
Are you going to deny it?
You better.
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
Yes, sir.
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
How's that again?
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
No I didn't.
Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
Oh, I'm very grateful.
What do you want?
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
No!
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.
Yeah.
Let me get my bag.
I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter -- because most of them try it again!  You know where I am if you need me.
No.
Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
Not particularly.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
Good night.
The party's over.
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
Get more coffee.
I took sleeping pills.
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
We talked about a lot of things.
You know I do.
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
He wouldn't.
Don't you ever stop talking?
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
What gives?
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
Oh -- oh!
Yeah.
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
My men --
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
Call me what, sir?
No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling. I looked in, an' it was turning gray. I couldn't stand it. I went into radio school.
No shit.
I don't know.
Looks that way.
Not a thing.
Mangoes? There as a fucking tiger in the woods -- I could've been eaten alive. I'm never going into that jungle again. I gotta remember never get out of the boat; never get outta the boat.
No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
Where ?
Who knows what's up there?
In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.
If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore.
Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
Ours.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
Terminate with extreme prejudice.
He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
A lame ?
Well, he's killing now.
I always thought the French came here to get the rubber.
Do you know that jungle?
We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
What, sir?
What?
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four -- hold -- we're right over you.
No. Walked.
I met him.
You'll find enough Cong up there.
Who?
I'm Kurtz.
Yeah.
How's the pain?
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I'm taking you back.
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
Both of us...
What?
Which one's the Colonel's?
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
It's a feeling you get in the jungle. When you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying.
That's me.
Why did they attack us?
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
Yes.
Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
Beverly Hills --
Needs patching.
Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
139  CONTINUED:
How?  Nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season.  Besides, I'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics.
Question is why they sat here when the storm moved in.  Check their stuff while I sniff around.
Six months.
Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
I'm staying.
My home is here.  With you.
I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.
-- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.
You got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?
You sound like the tourists. Know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  Fuck you.  You won't make it off this mountain.
I don't plan on dying.
I'm here to do my job.
You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  I'll be okay.
Cowardly bastard.  I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you.
You don't know how true that is.
But I would.
You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.
Good idea.  Flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises.  Go too low, one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it.
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
Fuck you.
Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.
Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?
Get the fuck out of here.
What you gonna do with it?  Large bore's for shit on small game.
Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
I want us to go out.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
Will you please take it?
I see the help -- judgement call.
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
How ya doing?
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
Is there another way to see it?
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
Nonsense!
Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.
Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
Never.
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
It was a mistake.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
Yeah... Well...
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
Okay. Good-bye.
Okay.
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
Yes. I really would.
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
I'll take care of myself --
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
Two years ago...
Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
Okay by me.
Do it.
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
Think white and get serious.
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
Okay, then.
Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
Get out.
Come on, sweetheart...
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
Thanks.
Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
I'm coming.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
Just a second -- he has to go.
What is this?
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
What?  You think I'm running you up?
How long have you been freelance?
We go around once.
What?  What's okay?
There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
I ain't scared of you.
You would be.
You're too late.
Do you want Rath or not?
The contract was stolen.
The contract?
Because he is trying to retire me.
Yes.
This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.
Why?
Where you wanted to be?
Ahhhh...
Why not?
Why?
Tell me about the first time.
Does that mean it didn't bother you?
You said you didn't trust it.
What?
Oh.  What do you think about?
Yes.
Here?
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
Taiwan.
Transmits and receives.
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
How do you know they're not?
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
Thank you.
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
No.
Why?
I'm not normal.
Martin.
Shit.
What?
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
Honesty.
Anytime.
Why not?
A dime.
Average.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
You mean quit?
No.
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
Like you?
You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
What's that? Free!
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
That makes you an expert I guess.
Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
I thought that was part of the charm!
Thought of everything haven't you.
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
We got a party tomorrow night. Can't have the place smelling like shit.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
We don't speak Czech!
Both, see you later.
No, not yet.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
Holly!
She's cool.
What?
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
So I hear.
What happened?
Lucky break!
Siberia.
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
What are you talking about?
No!
No, by road?
Regards to Her Majesty.
Sure. Excellent.
Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes. Without Jahn I might never find it... We'll just have a quick look and then you and I'll hit a tram.
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
Oh sure and you will want sex, always sex.
I hope so!
But I love you!
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
It's perfect, you've done a great job.
No, just a coffee.
I'll be okay, just get me home.
It's Josh's.
A kind of freedom.
I lied to you, I didn't destroy the floppy disks.
You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
You may use my office.
I insist, it is the least we can do.
Working....Under cover.
But I have to finish this....
Well come on, sit down.
Josh, I need your help. Doug's been arrested, he's in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might be able to do something.
Yes, if you can get him free.
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
We're not sure...
Some Americans?
Heart be still.
I don't want his money.
We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
Late night.  You?
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
I didn't know either.
No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
York Ave.
Scamming's a strong word.
What kind of a man are you, son?
No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
I don't want to have any conversation.
'They won't.'
-- This play means a lot to me.
Why?
So you agree you need help?
Good thing.
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
You don't believe in anything?
Belinda's a very jealous person.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
And why would that scare me?
I wanted this to be a date.
I have to get you home by one.
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
We're doing something -- ?
What are you talking about?
That what's happening to you, only faster?
Maybe you're not supposed to.
Not possible.
The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.
You planned this --
Sure.
I'm sick.
The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible.  I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
Anything you want.
I'm not going back to school.
I was going to fake it.
Lower. Same page.
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
I have expectations, too.
Lead man.
That won't be possible.
Either. Both.
I'm not tired.
I'd do that --
For pay?
I'd work backstage or something?
Then you remember more than I do.
I didn't say you did.
Uh, yes, sir...
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
Coming, Eileen...
What drill?
Good.
Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
Bic... It's a Bic pen.
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
Why?
George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
Run out of gas?
Operator, what's today's date?
No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
Home, school, here... 
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
A mall?
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
We're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be,  Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri-- the time chamber. Just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb....the power converter will do the rest.
Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
What did you do to yours?
Okay.
They come with the house.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
Mmmmm.
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
What're you doing?
Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Okay.
It's your play.
What?
You said that once already... Too late now.
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
He was nervous.
Excuse me.
I don't blame him.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
Yeah.
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Yes.
Maybe.
New Jersey?
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
Not really.  This is pretty important.
Where's the professor?
To get my guns.
Don't shoot!
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
Which?  The one in my throat.
Any time.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
A what?
I have a radio fix...
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
Where do you hail from, Doc?
Why me?
No!  Ditto the professor-
Flying to Cambodia.
Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.
That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
Really?...
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
Hah!
I'll bet. Jesus  "The grand productive days." What a goddamn phony.
Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
What else?
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
That's all right, really, thank you.
Okay... a quick one, sure...
Can be. Not easy, but 
Doesn't surprise me at all.
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Hell, I could tell you some stories
I can feel my butt getting sore already.
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Well, I can tell you some stories 
Nope.
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
You gotta believe me 
We gotta call the police 
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
...Both maybe?
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
Congratulations.
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
Uh-huh.
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
Anyway.
Excellent picture.
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
Did you find out about her parents?
You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
Bring 1976 up.
Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.
Thank you.
She said what you said she'd say.
Who's got access to my goddamn file?
Nilsen.
Sometimes I really hate you.
No.  I mean it, thank you.
Tell me about Catherine.
What did she tell me, Beth?
I got married.  He was on staff at the clinic.  I was down in Salinas.  It didn't... last long.
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
I don't smoke.
It won't last.
I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
You see?  We're both innocent, Nick.
She wiped out her whole family.
Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
Fine.
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
No.
I'll meet you there.
She's seen everything before.
I don't have a choice.
Make love to me.
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
No?
Try me.
Why?
I found Lisa Henderson.
What are you researching?
What happens to them?
Somebody has to die.
Somebody always does.
How did it end?
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
He was murdered.
Why would I need an attorney?
How's that?
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
She misses me.
It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop?  She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.
Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta my head for years.  Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems.  One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didn't know why she done it.
I got tired of being played with.
Somethin', though.
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
Why the hell not?
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
I'm sure.
Fuck you, too Nick.
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
Really. Huh. Too bad.
Not sure. How was yours?
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
The whole thing  painting.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
It's in New Jersey.
What's wrong?
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
Annina Nosei.
You name it, I paint there.
Hi Dad. Hi Nora.
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
Sure, ok..
I need a dealer.
They're just words.
Not black.
Yup.
Should there be?
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve  I mean Shenge.
Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.
The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic  writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
Who's John Henry?
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
I guess you did.
I do.  I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
You're your own baby.
What's that about?
You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.
Can you put me in the ring with him?
So what?
A what?
Yeah.
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
No, actually I feel worse.
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
"Shreck's."  You --
...four, five.
We do.
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
Maybe you're right.
I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
"We"?  You and...
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
It does to me.
You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog!
Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
Silent night, violent night...
... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
Oh no, those things frighten me.
You came to tuck me in.  That's quite a switch.  I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore.  But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
In spirit only, I'm afraid.
Thanks.
What seems to be the problem?
Specify, please.
Pheromones?
Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping.  And quite well, it seems.  Thanks to you, son.  Thanks to you all.
I recognized the accent.
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Alfred's happy here.
Divide and conquer.
What exactly are you doing?
I didn't kill your wife.
Mr. Freeze.
Surf's up.
She knows who we are.
From the other side of the equator-
I see you knew him.
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.
Bruce?  What are you doing?
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
Dick, don't push me right now.
Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
I find that unlikely.
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
What did you say?
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
Mystery.
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
Tonight's a good night.
How ya doin', Al?
Just checking, young sir.
And you are?
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
My life's an open book. You read?
You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.
Nostrovia.
Slanta.
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
Not much.
That's usually my line.
Excuse me.
What?
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
I don't want to remember!
What are you talking about?
Excuse me.
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name?
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
...You gonna kill me?
You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
Let's see if you bleed green.
Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?
Don't bogart that 'trode.
About what?
Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours.  Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.
Thank you, Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.
... Very good, sir.
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
WHICH CAR?
He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
No one would miss me.
I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.
Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
That's it.
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
... Behind the makeup?
Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
He's not crazy.
It's gone.
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
David, I'm serious!
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
Annie, it's me.
Yes.  Ahm... think I'11 ...
Ahm.....
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.
Great - keep him out of trouble.
Thank you Bernie.  Well done.  Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.
No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Ahm....
Quite right, sir.
Certainly is.
What makes you say that?
Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen?
Sure did.
Nope.
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
Yeah, heh heh.
Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all gonna die!
Heh heh. Yeah.
What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find that chick.
Me first! Me first!
Huh huh. We're gonna score now.
Yeah, heh heh. Damn right!
Cool, huh huh.
Uh, probably like, another five minutes or something.
Dammit!!!! Dammit!!!!
Huh? Huh huh.
Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
Heh heh. We wanna do her now!
Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
Yeah, we're gonna score.
Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
Heh heh, thanks.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Cut the power!
Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
That's why I'm bussing it across America. I'm so glad you're here.  Jim, I want you to meet two nice boys.
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
We're rich in what really matters.
It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
How's your arm?
Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some coffee.  You get some more firewood.
Two hours.
That's how long you were gone.
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
That's my girl!
<u>You</u> left me.
Not really...  what's this?
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
Who did the sushi?
Little black party dresses?
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
We're...
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
What do you mean?  What's he do?
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
They're dead.
I think so.
No, dummy.  Two.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
Let me have it.
I'm lonely.
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
They're ghosts.  They do what they want.
I saw some ghosts.
Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
Gooood!
Viridian?
Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.
I don't know.
What happened to the people who used to live here?
My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
... Straight out?
Thank you.
No, Robert.
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
There's no need for a hospital.
No. I'm a gardener.
Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
That's good.
Good night, Eve.
Fine. He's very nice.
Yes, so do we.
Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
I see.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
No, Eve. I like you to be here.
Yes. That could be true.
No. I'm not busy.
The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Ben is very ill.
Oh, good.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
Thank you, Ben.  ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.
Yes. That is correct.
No, Ben.
I understand.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
A flower...
Hello, Ronald.
I can't read.
What sort of bed is it?
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
Yes.
I never needed money.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
... Good evening, Louise.
I see.
Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
Yes, I'm very hungry.
Yes. That is surprising.
Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.
I am a very serious gardener.
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
I was given meals, and a home...
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you.  Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello.
Do you need a secretary?
... Yes, I am, Ben.
Good evening, Wilson.
Yes, ma'am.
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
It's not that, I just...
... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.
There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
Very good, Your Excellency.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
No, sir.
Oh? What?
That could be possible...
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
Yes, I did.
This is my fiancee Maxine.
Okay.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Yeah.
Tell your friends.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
May 11th.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
We'll talk about it in the car.
You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
After dinner I'll show you my puppets.
What?
Fuck Maxine.
Me and John.
Shut up!
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
Simulates?
I am a trained performer.
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
You're insane.
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
I'm right?
The usual, Barry.
You're a fag or a liar.
I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
Well, I'm a puppeteer...
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
What's he been in?
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Sure. It'd be fun.
My God.
A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
Ha ha ha!
Hush, sweetheart.
Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
Can I be anyone I want?
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
A scary dream?
But I think I have another plan.
Why are you being like this?
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Think, Jew florist?
Says who?
Do you?
You bastard!
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
Oh, Lotte...
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
You mean with Malkovich?
No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
It's okay, my sweet.
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
No, Stamp. I ain't.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You remember Halle.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
Baby, don't be like that.
Don't pay to complain.
Oh.
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
Don't matter. First time I'll be late in nine years. No great trouble..Whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time... don't matter...  The world is in this room, baby. This is all there is and all there needs to be.
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
Oh I been out.
Was over to Baby Suggs.
He ask, I give him anything.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
That's so.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
Oh yeah. I got big plans.
I don't want to know.
What yard? When who-
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
You're not dealing with morons here.
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw shit.  We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.  So let me make something plain.  I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk- off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off --do I make myself clear?
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping her conceive, man!
The?  Who the fff--
Fuck you.
Show me what you got.  Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
We have the urn.
That is for the urn.
Walter, how--
I'm going home, Donny.
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.
What the fuck is he talking about?
You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is--are you ready for this?-- Arthur Digby Sellers.
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Yes, uh, very impressive.
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude?
Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way you do business.  Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers. He lives in North Hollywood, on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies.  So if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent. . . of half a million. . . fifty grand.
Yeah man.
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
Take a look at this, sir.
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
Now I got--
Do you still have that doctor's number?
What do you do for fun?
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
What?
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
Am I wrong!
Huh?
It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
Easy, Dude.
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  That's the beauty of it Walter!
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of rest.  Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?
Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
What about the toe?
Dude--
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
Huh?
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out there after the, uh, the.
Look, man, did you--
Is the car out front yours?
Dude?
Yeah?
What the fuck are you talking about?
You know this!
Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell happened?
AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
Then what's...
A hundred and eighty dollars?!
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
Who is this?
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Dude.
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
Well. . . yeah.
You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.
A world of pain.
Impressive.
We'll take 'em in the morning.
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
Like cancer with a purpose.
Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!
If that's true, then why'd you save me?
I don't understand.
Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
You put a bullet in my brain.  Wouldn't expect anything else.
I don't like it.
Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
Blood...
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him.
Human?
He was here.  Watching us.
Getting your attention, Paco.
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.
Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
I was backpacking.  Hooked up with these two chicks who were off to see the Burning Man festival.  We were gonna take "E", have ourselves a little freeball out in the desert.  You know the riff, "Dear Penthouse, I never thought this would happen to me, but --"
You should've killed her, then.
Don't even start, old man.
I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
How can you be out here?
I don't buy it.
Pass.
I'm sorry, I --
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
He didn't. Get over it.
Like me.
Some kind of archive --
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
For your miracle cure?
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
Then what is it?
No problem.
Sometimes --
Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --
You're wrong, Dragonetti.
That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
Get away from him!
No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
Habit, mostly, just like this.
Because it means the tree is older than the house.
Don't know--just that she was afraid--
To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
--Christ almighty--
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
--whatever; that's her.
Why is there no "our" here?
--fine, later, fine.
No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
We're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.
--bullshit!
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
You have to go.
I can't let you in.
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
No.
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
--there's something <u>here</u>, Nick--
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
I do.
Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.
Yeah?
Butt-ugly owl.
What're you, nuts?
Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.
I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
My room, asleep, last I checked.
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
No idea--goddamitt!
--I saw what I saw.
--turn the camera off--
--Graduate Thesis--
I'm not finished.
Fine.
It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
--I dunno, I just woke up--
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.
--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
--still go see the OB in the morning--
No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
I can't!
--shit!!!
At least you still have the tapes.
Okay.
No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
That's why she kills children.
Get some more beer.
Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.
Whatever.
Yeah.
--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
I don't....
--it's urgent!
His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
Yeah.
Your husband.
You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here?
Door's locked. Nothing there.
Yeah? What happened?
...Mm-hmm.
Abby... you all right?
Abby--
I said you're bad.
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
...What was that?
Isn't that what you want?
I think someone's watching.
I don't follow baseball.
You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
Going out with Meurice.
I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years.
Ever durned one.
What?
See, I never knew that.
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?
How long did you watch her?
Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.
I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
What.
Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.
What's the point?
Where?  ...I'm very careful about that.
What's that?
I've seen a few.
Okay honey.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Darling, where are the glasses?. Oh. here they are.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
It must be great.
Yes?
Okay.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  . Hey, pretty, pretty.
Yeah.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
No. Come on.
No.
You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
No. What is happening?
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
Don?. Are you in with them?
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
Please. please stay.
I'm doing it.
Yes.
Does that scare you?
Sometimes I think I do.
You put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease.
It's okay. it's okay.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Maybe so.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Why not?
Yeah.
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
Okay, Sandy.
You better not, Jeffrey.
I'm really sorry.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
Dorothy Vallens?
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Do you want the car?
Alright.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
You can change it if you want to.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
Okay.
What?
That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
Five-thousand per kilo.
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
You'll see for yourself.
Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
What?  Yeah, sure.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
Excuse me?
I see.  How much?
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
It's your grass.
We want some grass.
It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting.
Barbara and me.  No one else.
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
Nice doing business with you, George.
I heard.
No fucking way.
You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?
Because they caught me?
Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
I love you too, man.
No more brothers, Diego.
The boy is happy, Fred.  Don't be such a killjoy.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.
Actually, it was three.
With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him.
And Diego?
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
Not mad.
Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.
Figured what out?
I said, I've seen it before.
Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
Out.
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
Dad.
Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on...
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
You swear?
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
I know, Dad.  I know...
Shhhh.
We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's lockdown time.
Yes, I am.
Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.
The strike is a success; but ...
Third group.
Don't move, Hacene.
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
Let's try ...
It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
Of course I am.
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
It could've happened to anyone.
Why?
You got something on the Coke?
Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
But there's more?
You may call your next witness.
Counsel approach the bench.
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
No.  I haven't done it in years.
No -- but I can get it for you.
Yes.
Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
Yes.
For about one year.
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
Who was your primary beneficiary?
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
We stopped seeing each other.
She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
No further questions.
No.
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
Then -- those are not your own words?
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
Yes.
We dated for about a month last year.
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.
No.
Yes -- cocaine.
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape.  It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her, didn't he?
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
A.M -- or P.M.?
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
No.
Because he called me.
Yes.
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
I know.
No -- it just doesn't look right.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
It's not my taste.
I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
Yeah.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
You take a lot for granted.
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
You can see me now.
What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
Are you scared?
She's waiting in the conference room.
Why?
I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
Attractive.  Bright.  Distant. Charming when she wants to be.
Yeah -- but can she cook?
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
Why didn't you come to me?
Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it?
What time did you leave?
No -- never.
It didn't get there from me.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
We were here two Christmases ago.
I said NO!
I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
He's not coming.
Michael.
Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose.  But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
Did we want to?
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
You're right -- that is sick.
No, what?
They got heat in Michigan.
That's it.
Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
Oh! You caught me.
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
Why?
That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.
She starts sniffing me.
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.
You want to go back in?
I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.
No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
No.
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
Oh, sure. Great.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
Couple. Want to help?
How about Bari?
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
Yes, thanks.
What?
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
But now that you have it -
Yes. And I've accepted.
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
Frannie.
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
What's her name?
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
You people really don't like dogs.
Take who where?  What you smokin'?
Just some flies.
That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
Don't you worry about a thing.  This hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
How did you get in here?
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
Just a bad place.  And the doorway to worse.
You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
My God.  My dress.  We have to find it. And burn it.  And shut the door.
My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
I can't find you.
Fuck it.  Alright.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
You were just a kid.
I didn't sell it.
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
That's it.  Get out.  Now!
You was just doing your job.
No more thoughts from your asses.  Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me?
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
Potential toxic dump site.
No thanks.
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
Know what?
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
What are you talking about?
No!  They're still on their way.
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
But you know he did it.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Caesar, maybe we should run --
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
No.
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
Caesar, this is crazy.
Caesar ...
Just hurry.
Don't tell him --
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
You need the money just like we do.
I had to.  You made me.
You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.
Sure, Gino, sure.
Pretty good, sir.
It's all right, sir.
Go right ahead, sir.
Why?
Are you okay, Violet?
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.  Violet!
This is the police, ma'am.
How do I know you are cops?
All right.
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
Good guess.
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
Thanks.
Sure.
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
What do you want?
...  yes.
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
Yes, it is.
The redistribution of wealth?
Nothing.
Shit, here we go.
I think so, too.
That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
Yeah.
Trust me, Violet.
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
Thank you.
I won't.
That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
No.
I think everything is okay.
You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
I want a second opinion.
I'm not asking.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
Yeah, I know...
Yes.  Is he there?
Excuse me?
Get the fuck away from my car.
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
I want to go home.
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?

Nothing.  It's just not there.
I don't know.
I was shot twice in the back.
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
Where are we?
I can't believe I slept.
That's it?  Is that it?
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
I guess so.
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
-- forget it --
I don't know. 
xxxxxx
Think I could rent a scooter?
So get the hell out of here.
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- 
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
-- he accessed the account --
All of them?
-- we're evacuating the building --
No.
...elephoned sir.
...aven't you?
You don't have to sing it.
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
I'm waiting for my daddy.
- In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life.
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
You sound worried.
Er, I knew you looked different.
Ah ...
Not really, no.
I'm sure you have
What has Tuttle done?
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas. 
Jack ...
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
Information Adjustments.
If you say so.
Oh.
Who are you?
Them?
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
What parcel?
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
Every day?
Who will?
Get away!
Stop it ... damn you!
Oh God! What have we done?
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
Where are you going?
Take care.
It's not our mistake!
What a BITCH!
The refund for Tuttle!
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
I did it for you.
I'm sorry but ...
You're not listening, mother.
Mistake?
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
Thank you for calling Cen -
What? Who is this?
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
It's all right, Terry, it's all right, everything's all right.
It's a 27B/6 of course.
What is this?  Who the hell are you?
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
No. Wait here.
On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
You can trust me on this one.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
He flipped out.
Mary said you might be coming.
Sleeping in the back.
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
I can't hold up my head anymore.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
No.
Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
Ten-four, hon.
What did you say?
I guess there's always a chance.
Our Lady of Misery.
No.
I think it looks good.
Okay.
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
Fifteen minutes.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
The ghosts--
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
That's too many.
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
I quit! I'm through!
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
How can that be? He was getting better.
You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
Yes.
Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
How's he doing?
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
That's ridiculous.
You learn that in the army?
Frank!
What?
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
You really think so?
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
Yeah.
You write this?
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
Why?  What did they do to you?
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
I don't like the word gay.
We can cut back at the end.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
People phoned in.
I'm not kidding.
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
Yeah -- being a basket case.
This isn't friendship.
Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
I hope so...  No.  I'm not really mad.  I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?
Really?
Well -- my wife got this new job...
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Move away from me.
Almost immediately.
Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
Well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
Yes, there is.
Yes?
I spent a fortune on this.
It's started.
Nobody else had it.
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
Oh.
I'll speak to you.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
No.  Not even you.
I don't know.
No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
It's not.
I was a lot earlier.
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.
I trust you.
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
Billion.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
Okay.
What?
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
Where are you?
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
How can you say that to me?
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
Why did I have to do this to myself?  Watch you take off.  Call me if you need anything.
Go ahead -- what?
I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up.  I'll get you a great tour.
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
Uh-huh.
I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
Shh!
Righto.
Yeah it was all just an accident.
It wasn't easy.
Now you're a professional!
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Better!
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
You think I'm creative?
That means you like me!
What are you trying to say?
What?
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?
I admit it.
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
Not only that, he copied us!
I know, man.
Didn't you hear him?
Well I was uh, just looking...
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
Well...
A parakeet?
I-I already got a new one!
N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
No...look I'm busy...
You're like an undercover guy!
Smack?
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
Good morning Walter!
Here here!
Why not?
T-turned on?
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
I was just straightening up the place.
What's the matter with you!
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
What's with you?
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
Yeah, I guess.
Probably.  What movie is this?
Don't tread on the earth?
Maybe.
Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
Nothing.  It was just a dream.
Hi.
I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
'Bye.
Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
Didn't you get my message?
You weren't home.  Like always.
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
You guys are thrashed.
It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
Water.  Okay.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.
Pretty shallow of you.
I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Like my homework.
I forgot.
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
Get out of my facial.
I'm looking for you, actually.
To bring you... your birthright.
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
In Virginia.
Lothos.
We wait for Robert to wake up.
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
We'll cover it later.
But you enjoyed it, yes?
Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
I had to test you.
A what?
Five.
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
I was just scared is all.
Thanks.
Could be.
Throw it out.
Nee sitch.  No way.
Does Jeffrey know?
Right!
I don't think so.
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
Big League pitchers don't use these.
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
Switch nostrils?
A little better.
Nuke?!
Get over here.
No, no, it was great.
You can't seduce me.
What a nasty thing to say.
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
What do you believe in?
So...Wanta make love?
Let me.
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
I want you desperately!
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
You okay?
Who?
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
He looks great, just great!
Well shit, then, let's fuck.
We gonna fuck or what?
If you believe in Voodoo.
You missed him!
How?
A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
I won't have to.
God--what a Big League move.
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
Learn your cliches.  Study them. Know them.  They're your friends.
Let go of me!
What?
Yeah, thanks for everything.
You too...Meat.
What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
Love to--
I ain't hitting a man first.
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
It's a damn easy thing to play with.
We'll pray anyway.
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
Better find our bonus baby, eh?
C'mon big 'un, you're okay...
Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
Jim looking for somebody.
They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
What are you talking about?
Was I at that dinner?
I was in the building!
Yes, you were.
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
Excuse me.
...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -
Yeah.
Wait, hold on a second.
Speeding?
Hey, little Dale Evans.
Well...
Okay.
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
Ginger.
Honey, come here.
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
Four aces, Doc.
You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
Then he called me a faggot.
Okay.
Why, somebody's complaining?
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
I don't wanna come along with you.
I'll be honest with you.
I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
Yeah.
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
No, a...
Why?
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
Well...
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
What can I do?
No, Ace.
Okay. 
Hey, Mitch.
I - I - I...
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
Yeah.
But as much as they loved her...
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
What? What?!
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
...twenty-five thousand?
Mm-hm.
First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
Let go of me! Let go of me!
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
You're not takin' Amy.
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
I threw it away.
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
What'd you have?
What if he won't stop?
I can back him off.
Listen to me.
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
You fuckin' whore!
You want your jewelry?
Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!
Oh, you are...
Let me in the house! Fucker!
Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor.  What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam
How many kids do you have?
That's amazing.
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
I really think you're -
What?
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Mm.
You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
Shut your mouth!
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Hi. Good.
You can't talk to me like...
Yeah?
Now move along.
I did - I didn't -
He tries to do everything...
He's gone?
For what?
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
He's good. He's fine.
Yeah.
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
I do.
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
Oh, come on.
Nothin'.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Sure did.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
Is that what you want?
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
But I saw something...
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Okay?
Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
'Go! Go! Go!'
Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
Hold it, hold it. Here.
Pleasure.
Remo.
...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
So are we.
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
Shh.  Hide her car in the back!
Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
No, no, no, no!
Ch-Charlie M!
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
Hey.
How you doin'?
You sure?
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
I'm sorry.
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
All right, all right. But I - I -
You are right. What can I...
Having a good time?
Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you..
I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this.
That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.
I don't know. I can't remember.
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..
A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you, Jeff.
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
Even the skylight?
He didn't remember to roll up his window...
Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
"Well done," Cactus.
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
Absolutely.
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
I still have one left...
Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.
I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
Enough.
But of course you are.
I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
Uh-huh..
But I'm blind.
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
You going to talk all day?
Thanks.
I don't see anybody in there but you.
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
I want the gun emptied.  I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out.  That's all. <u>OUT</u>!
So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
Make a "U" and go back.
What do you keep making me out to be?
We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
You don't understand.
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.
How much time do you have left on it?
Sometimes I paint.
They say my work is somewhat derivative.
I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
I can hear you again, clearly.
No.
I'm trying to.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
You knew about me.
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
Why are we stopping?
That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
Took preparation.
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
We don't see you.
It's your call.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
Are you trying to panic the women?
Put the girl on.
What are you planning to do when they got here?  They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
My compensation!  Somebody still owes me -- big time!
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
Mind if I have a look?
Hold on.
Let her tell you.
Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
Is that good or bad?
Yeah?
An excellent quality.
Stop it, Dil --
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
Did I?
Please, Dil --
She's not that either.
Not in my experience.
Guy I work with.
Like treacle.
Must be.
They all get the wrong idea.
Where?
What look?
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
Tell me about him.
Maybe.
Yeah.
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
Depends what it is.
Dil --
Don't call me that.
Shut up.
I said stop it.
You think that's wise?
Probably.
Are you pretending yet?
Stop it, Jimmy.
A little.
Please, Jimmy.
Only if you kiss me.
Why, honey --
You gonna tell me why?
You could say that.
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
I promise.
Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
I was trying to get out of something.
You mean that?
I will be.
Jimmy?
Stop it, Dil --
Let them come then.
Never.
I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
Don't call me that --
Thirty-five.
As the man said, it's in my nature.
You know her, Jimmy?
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
My pleasure.
Suits you.
Yes.
No, what is the thing?
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
You know what. Go.
You may be right.
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
Do you want a cup of tea?
Aye, I do, Peter.
Good. So what do you think?
Can't.
I can smell her perfume.
I'm talking about your people, not you.
She's not my type.
What?
The fastest.
How different?
My pleasure, Jody
Give us a break.
Don't be so sure.
Doesn't matter where.
Having a pint in the Rock.
Like what?
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
What do you believe in?
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
Some kinds of women are...
Want you to do something, Fergus.
If they kill me --
But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her.
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
What does that mean?
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
What you say, faster?
You don't know me, do you?
You didn't?
He believes in the future --
No, we are.
First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
What about it?
I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
Relax -- you're gaining.
You're going to look for him -- now?
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Let's look anyway.
Can you remember anything at all?
With whom? Where?
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
No!
I heard you, I heard you.
His -- real -- ?
Oh, I see.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
Barely, yes.
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
But no one actually saw him die.
I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
Next, please.
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Brian.
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
You'll wreck your raincoat.
I said with the mouth shut.
What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide?  Then I take it there are no objections.
I'll take that.
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
I met a man with sharp nails.
Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Reggie -- listen to me --
Okay.
Cutting it out.
Oh. 
That sounds like their problem.
What -- like Scobie?
Shut the door!
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
It's a start, anyway.
Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
Fiction or non-fiction?
Well!
And the last one?
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Flix -- are they for sale now?
That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
Meaning what?
Stop it!
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
A letter? May I see it?
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
I found it! I found it!
I'm Regina Lampert.
Yes.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
The man and the woman are married --
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
Having a nervous breakdown.
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
Please stop -- please!
Don't you want me to stay?
Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
We will separate -- you look over there.
He took care of Charlie for us.
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
No.
Calm down Brent.
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
You are upset.
Are you sure?
It can't be.
Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
Run!
She just turned off her light.
She works at a church?
I can.
I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
Daddy....
You're not?
No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.
What are you doing here?
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
Of course I'm scared.
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
Why?
You eventually have to talk to him.
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
Does she fuck?
The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
FINE. Are you?
I won't.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Twenty eight years ago.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
I did.
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
Did Sharon say no?
I'll think about it.
I love you.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
Attacked how?
You didn't believe her?
And the police did nothing?
Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.
There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
And she didn't?
Hi Sandy.
What?
Yes. Unfair to me.

Freezer in the back.

Except for the fact that I need cash.
He could've.  That-That's true.  But that would've been smart...
...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
That'll make up the difference, huh?
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.

For cryin' out loud.
I got, like, uh....
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
Are you kiddin'?
...all the time.
 Excuse me...
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!
God-...
Okay, okay! 
...-ed.
 
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 
I don't think we have much of a choice...
Come on.
Whoo!
 I made it.
Shit.  You gotta pass him. 
Holy--!
 Go, go.
...yeah.

...to him!  You don't know who...
I'm crazy?
What?

 All right.  Hey.

What?
...-tion?
And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
You know.
We were nationally  ranked.
Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
...hospital.
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
...shit.

We're gonna die!

 Okay.
Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.
What?

...on!
 
It's working.
Why'd you stay behind?!


Hello.
Oh, oh!
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
Oh, my God.
...such is the price...of patriotism.
Mason, you have to take this...

You-You can't let him...
He's the dude...
Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
Are you crazy?!  Take the boat?!
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
But you have no choice but to follow orders.
Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
Is this stool taken?
So far, ye-yes.

Oh, you're two of a kind, doc.  Oh, he may not have your sheepskins, and...

Take it easy, Jake.
If that's what it says.
Thanks.
It doesn't hurt.
I think I gave it to her.
Where from?
That's too bad.
You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
I've got her.
Yes... I think I can manage...
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
I don't know...
You sure this is okay?
I've been wanting to meet you.
How are you, Lou?
You're welcome to try. There he is.
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
I don't.
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
I heard it was an accident.
C'mon I'll show you.
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
What for?
Do you know where she might be?
Well yes.
What are you having?
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
Mrs. Mulwray?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Oh... thank you.
How did you find out?
Did he know?
No, not for that one.
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
I gave everybody the night off.
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
...A flaw...
It has to do with my father.
He owns it. You know?
What about?
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?
...That's not what I meant.
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
She's my daughter.
Back to Mexico.
How about a plane?
He didn't wear bifocals.
But, Mr. Gittes.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
Oh no.
Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
Of course.
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
Maybe he takes it very seriously.
I'm sorry, I --
Yes...
Yes?
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
Yeah.
Who?
Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
...Yes of course.
Yeah.
He's not in, Mr.?
Yeah.
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
So I can have these? 
Then why don't you change jobs? 
Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
It tastes wonderful!
Come in, Alfredo.
Why? What do you mean?
Yes. 
What's she like? What's she like?...
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
No. And nobody knows where she is.
I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...
Who?
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
What does it say there?
I can't take shorthand.
Two cents.
Oh!
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
Well, well - isn't that nice?
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
You know why?  She was so -
Certainly not.
Certainly not.
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
September the ninth?
Ask them to sit down.
There is no news big enough.
Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
Charles.
I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right.  He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind.
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
Thanks.
In the water.
I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
No.  But you're close.
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
Oh, me -
I didn't say.
Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
Susan, it seems to me -
I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
You're right.  We did lose a million dollars last year.
All right.
Can't say, sir.
I didn't used to be afraid of it.
Yes?
Go ahead.
That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
Why, Brad?
No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
Brad, you are drunk.
You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking.
What do you mean by that?
It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
I can remember everything.  That's my curse, young man.  It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  I was his oldest friend.  As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' his friend.  If I wasn't, he never had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -
Rawlston is my boss.
Yes.
Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
Right here, Mrs. Kane.
I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
Queer?
Rosebud?
Am I sure about what?
What is this, a poll?
Okay. I'm sorry about that.
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
The ones in this town, yes! You encourage their growth, their habit. You're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! For good, cancer-merchant!
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
Can I join in?
Exactly.
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
But you were.
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
Let me take you out tonight.
I hear that's a rather popular date.
What about Sing?
He's your fianc.
So what are you saying?
Like what?
Was it you?
Call the police.
What time was this?
Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
I'll assess all I want!
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
Lenin's Tomb.
So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
Yeah.
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
Shocking abuse of authority.
Chess team Allan Harris?!
What about Veronica?
Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
You know what I just watched?
There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
And the second time around...?
I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today.
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
You know what pisses me off the most?
Sorry.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
Can we not talk about this?
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
Gatorade.
Exactly. They drank it all.
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
If you go, I go.
What, your dick?
I never tried it.
What?
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
I know I'm your hero.
And this is what you rented?
I don't; you did.
I'm not. She just left.
I'm not.
This is my way of spitting water at life.
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
What responsibility?
Leave me alone.
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
You need a ride?
I don't have love handles.
Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.
They are not.
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
A half hour.
Nothing personal.
It's not my store.
Lasagne.
Maybe.
She's my girlfriend.
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
Bunch of savages in this town.
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
She called you, didn't she?
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
Really?
Something wrong?
Including you?
Twelve.
Three.
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
He gets off on it.
Please calm down.
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Lower your voice!
I'm going to class.
Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
I don't want Caitlin...
Randal...?
What?
You gotta hear him sing.  Olaf, "Berserker!"
I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer?  Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
He's got his own band in Moscow. It's called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans" or something like that.
Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too.
Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
No, I wasn't.
I hope it feels good.
I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
He didn't ask me to...
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
C'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!
No way, death-breath, that was too intense for thunder.  C'mon let's rock an' roll.
Hal will have my head for this.
I admit, I can be bought.
I copy.
Where's the radio?
What usually eats a banana?
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
It can't fly in this weather.
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
Would you?
Give him the money.
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
That's it, you look like a professional.
Help me!  I don't want to die!
Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?
We spent a night there one night...
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
After the funeral I just had to leave.
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
He doesn't want my help.
What are you doing here!?
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
What about you?
I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
You attacked me.
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
Up ahead.
Never
Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up!
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too.
Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.
No, he's gone.
We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
There is.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
Tucker and Walker.
It looks like a winding route.
Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  Don't you see what he's doing!  He's hijacking the shipment!
The monitor! I never ask twice.
There, what's that place?
We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  Where's the next one?
Richard Travers.
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? Georgie rises.
Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.
... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
How do you do, sir?
Missus. Very pleased to meet you.
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
Tell me more, Georgie Boy.
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
Hi, hi, hi there, my little droogies.
Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
Well - I'm back.
Aye.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
You're gonna be sick are you?
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
No, sir.
Crabs?
Lice?
Right. Halt the prisoner. Good morning, sir, I'm Chief Officer Barnes. I've got 655321 on a transfer from Parkmoor to the Ludovico Centre, sir!
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
Yes!!!
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
I'm sure it won't be long now.
You're not cured yet, my boy.
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
You have, my son.
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
Prison custody?
Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?
Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
What?
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
Jesus...
Oh, my, yes.
I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
I think...
Twenty five?
No.  Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
So?  It was a random thing.
Jesus.  Two in one night?
Not our call, Phil.
This isn't our goddamn game!
No harm done, ma'am.
Mom, Vincent.  Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.
Who the hell is this?
Let's not get excited, sir.
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
Me, specifically?
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
Two, two-fifty.
You always stutter?
No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
You're cool.
It's not me.
What?
How?
Lenny, my dispatcher.
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
Yes, Max?
I listen to classical.
I never learned jazz.
Leave me alone.
There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother!
Jazz.
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
It's not bullshit.
Why?
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
Why?
No.
Makes two of us.
Who?
I don't know.
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
No, not just that.
What's at Union Station?
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
You're full of shit.
Vincent?
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
Let her go.
Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
Excuse me?
The guy came right at us!
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
I can't promise you anything.
You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
What is it with you and the space program?
You're certifiable.
I've been reading up on it.
Can you prove any of this?
Is this your dad?
Realized what?
A water main broke.
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
What's in Connecticut?
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
Because he believed me.
They'll trace it.
Where are you?
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
I can't promise you anything.
Could you be a little more specific?
Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own.  Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
I'm not sure what you mean.
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
I'm leaning toward no.
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
The truth shall make you free.
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
Working.
What the hell does that mean?
Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.
Where do you think Jerry is?
What do you suggest?
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
What?
Yes, sir.
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
You're --
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
You can't just pull the plug, David.
Are you threatening me?
Actually I'm running late --
... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
Thank you?
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
It's beautiful.
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
The librarian... or the library...?
A page-break signal.  A period.
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
Can't.  Doctor's orders.  The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?
I do.  More than anything.  But I am also a realist.  Soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home.
Actually --
-- I'm moving to Washington.
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
Jesus --
It's really happening.
Like it or not.
And where exactly does that put your position...?
Make that two.
Why?
You're willing to die for this.
An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?
Please --
And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
It was quite a page turner.
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
Recommendations?
Git your shovel and git to work.
I'll make it a dollar.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
I ain't askin' what you'll do after you get out, because I'm gonna be dead and it don't matter.
She took off with that convertible feller...
Gotta go, Arletta.
Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
Ram it in and break it off!
He's probably a gigolo.
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
She's got him! You hear that?
Tramp! Beautiful!
Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
Get away!
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
Well --- okay. It's a deal. One cold drink, if'n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
He's gonna be awright.
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
That fool. That damn fool.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
Cuter.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
Kick a buck.
That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
How about you tryin' to make me?
What are you talking about?
No. No chains either.
What did I do?
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
You've got a date right <u>here</u>, Andy. This has got to...
Tell her about <u>what</u>?
Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?
What pattern was that?
When was that?
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
You're calling me a crank?
Is he out?
What calls?  I haven't made any calls.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.
Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
Then what do you need me for?
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
Yes.  I have to go...
Go and look for a note.
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
Let's get out of here...
Yessir.  I have reflected on that, sir.  Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir.
I know.  Get out here.
You're damn right I do.
I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it.
I gotta have Ruben, and a...
You messed with the evidence.
What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
Thank you.
I'll listen for you buzzing over.
Outside in the visitors, car park.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
It is?
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
Are we imagining it?
I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
Yes.  They felt like traffic accidents.
No.
Are you still involving me in your crash?
I can drive.
Yes.
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
Where are you?
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
Really?
Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
You look beautiful.
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
Come on.
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
I've already made arrangements.
Not even if it's something positive?
Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
I'm glad.
I answered these questions last night.
OK, OK, I'll give it back.
Don't be ridiculous.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
What are the delusions like?
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
Break up?    They wish.
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
Do you?
I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
Thanks.
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
It wasn't exactly a lie.
I guess so.
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
Well then why'd it happen?
You should go.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
I mean tonight.
Sure. Of course.
No, it's not like that.
Something you did?
I think we need to talk about some things.
Especially this last year.
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
No, no.
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
It doesn't matter who.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
I think I've heard this speech before.
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
You killed her!
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
Uh, yeah.
What?
You don't trust me?
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
You want me to help you get out of the country?
We can't.
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
I'm not any closer than you are.
And the Vodka.
You didn't buy batteries?
Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
What for?
You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.
Do I?
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
No?
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
How much?
Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
French guys?    You mean like from France?
What'd they take?
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
Oh, I'm sorry.
Good song though.
I was told to take what we have and go.
I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.
Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
We've got to get out of here.
I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.
I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
It's my idea.
No!
The hell it is.
Uh huh.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, I dig him.
And you don't speak French?
Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
I don't know.
Tonight.
Take a nap.
Something like that.
Something like that.
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
What's it to you?
Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
I'll never live as a thief!
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
Don't bother.
So what if I don't?
I have a guest.
I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
Yes, from the West.  He went undercover and and followed her here,
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
Spare your energy.  I'll be back!
Jen!
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
Give me back my comb.
Jen...
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
What about you?
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.
A murderer?
A female criminal!  Now that's news!
We must avenge mother!
Father!
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
What do you have in mind?
Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's chocolate you, know.
Don't thank me.
Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
And she'll be alive.  Up here.
In a better place.  I hope.
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
She's still dead.
Mom tried to cook.
I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
Another jolly nickname?
I can see her.
You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
Interested?  Follow the crow.
Leave me alone -- !
Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I might die.  I've already done that.  I don't need anyone's help.  Yours included.
Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
That's right.
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
From who?
No.
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
What'cha reading?
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
Why not?
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before?
Give it up.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
Who?
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
Wait, don't hang up.
You must take me for a real idiot.
Yes it does.
I have feelings for you.
Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
Hi.
What are you saying?
I love you.
I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
I'm sorry about that.
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
Don't think it's not going to cost you.
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
Do you want to learn or not?
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
No.
Well did you like it?
It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
I swear.
You promised to let me kiss you.
I know.
I know.
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
It works a little.
Honey, is something wrong?
Baby?  Right on time.
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
I see your point... though why should I care?
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
Could you be more desperate to read it?
Even there?
Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
But who will they turn to for help?
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
Cecile.
I'm aware.
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Where is she?
Oh yes.
I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
Excuse me?
I want to fuck.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
I have a flair for drama.
Thank you. Now, where were we?
Come again?
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
It's Cecile.
You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.
I've already told you, she's not home.
It's really important.
I did?
Excuse me?
Nope.
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
You're a lucky guy.
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
Yes, darling.
Do you know the people?
You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
Times have changed.
What do you mean?
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
What?
I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
Well, you know where it is.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
Yes, daddy.
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
But I didn't play with them, Daddy.  They wouldn't play with me.
It's true.
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
Because she is my friend.
In the garden? Would she be there now?
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
For as long as you'll let me.
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
A princess?
Oh, thank you, Amy.
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
But she's dead!
I wouldn't be surprised if it were a true wishing ring.
I'm trying to.
Will you come soon?
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days  those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
Who is she?
No, thank you.
I can't do it! I can't do it!
It was pale...a shadowed gold.
Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
Good night...Barbara...
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
Never felt better.
No, it was another woman.
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
Does she have PMS?
What does that have to do with me?
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
Anything's better than Mark.
Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
Only to see.
Frida, grab that red one.
And she got the medium.
Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
Rule one: always wear make-up.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
Give him the tampon test.
Okay. I guess so.
It is so hot in here.
No they're not.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
I haven't gotten it yet.
Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
Tuesday. Are you okay?
Okay, I gotta go.
He's been here all night?
What? Why'd you do that?
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
About Mark? Carlton?
Frida? You okay?
Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
So pee? Here?
I can't help it, it smells so good.
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Yeah?
Did you change your hair?
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
Very well then. Is that all?
Used to? Did it stop finally?
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
Briefs.
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
Okay, you busted me.
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
Interesting possibility.
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
What? Is there someone else?
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
What about... those guys... I might have...
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
Thanks.
No, I said it was our first date.
No, take it.
Packages of money.
Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
Tell her I'm eating.
Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
We can just take this pillowcase.
Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
What makes her think that?
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Not really...
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
Just visiting my patient.
Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
Loose ends?
A hunch.  He might be able to...
Yes, sir.
Don't know much, do you?
What is going on?
Yes.
Wait, this isn't fair...
You seem restless.
Then we must call the police.
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
I have to go...
No, it's the truth.
I'm...  being...  punished.
They're dead, John.
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
Uh -- I don't know.   Sometimes it's just like a barter thing...  Is this legal?
Don't worry.
And we're going away for a holiday.
I promise.  I won't.
Great.
... Alright.
Great.
Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here.
Fine...
I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.'  So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
TilT we figure something out.
It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
I was a senator, you know.
Clean.
Are you out of your mind?
Oh.  Excuse me.
He was only doing his job.
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
Dave -- I'm working.
It's fine.
The government
I'm not sure.
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
So what do we do?
That'd be great.
In the car?
A teleprompter.
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
Fertility beads.
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
What?
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
I can't say.
No.
What about it?
`Bleed for your king.'
Thanks, Duane.
Go tuck yourself, Bill.
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
Mind if I sit down?
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
I don't know.
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
Home.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
Truman used it all the time.
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
... Me, too.
Dammit...  I told them no mayo.  See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...
We're doing our best, sir.
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.
He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead place. Like all the others.
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the heads.
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
Sir!
No, sir.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
Well, no shit, Sherlock
Knox?
What is the Dead Poets Society?
At Chet Danburry's house.
Yep.
Except sex.
Garden?
I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
And are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say?  If all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other, what the hell are we doing?
But...
All right!  I'm thinking!  "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments; love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove."
Good.  We're very excited about him.  He was a Rhodes Scholar, you know.
Yes... sir.
Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?
That's not my fault.
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Knox!  what are you doing here?
I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
It's just for a little while. You promised.
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
Yawp!
His hands reach out and choke me All the time he mumbles slowly.  Truth... Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
Then you're playing a part for him too, aren't you?  A dangerously self- destructive one.
I can't just forget her, Pitts.  And I certainly can't think about math!
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
Yes sir.
What is it?
My brother went here.
I'll take him over mine.
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
I guess.
Oh. 
Yea, art thou there?
He's the owner...
And where is our point of arrival?
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
Did you clear this?
That's where my boat's moored.
Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
It ain't any better out there!
I saved your life is what I did!
Then who are you?
What are you people talking about?
Jesus Christ lady...
Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
Right... You have a boat.
You quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living...
No...
I don't take orders at all.
Forget them...
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
I'm flying blind here God damn it!
Me??
I don't know...you got what we need?
Line it up now, nice and easy...
Joey...
Poolside?
Maybe plans changed...
What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo?
We're all going.
Hey! Fuckin' A!
What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?
Yeah, Sal--
It is too! Now you passed it!
They did not!
I know, but...
She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
It won't open.
Couple of weeks... Listen --
Yeah.
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
I show you. Come. You come.  Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right?
Yeah?
Who's got the ammo?
No?
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
Sal's alive???
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
No.
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
Naw, it's... I mean...
I don't know.
I... No. You do this for money?
From Nam?
Merle --
You got it.
What else?
Merle...
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
That's my plan.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
Yeah!
That's who.
Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!
Never one.
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths.
Technothugs?
Wade's here.
What did you say?
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
Kimberly!
Your mother.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
Out of the room.
We have to talk.
Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
Fine.
How do I look?
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
Yes.
Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
Relax, let technology do the work.
Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
I'm here.
And you should be with your family.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
What's it mean?
This little thing says I can't.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
No -- that's for me to do.
No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --
Of course I will.
Thank you, Belle --
It hasn't opened yet?
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
And what about Daniel Webster?
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
All right, darling.
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
Belle.
Some other time, Stevens.
I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
I do -- and I think you should too.
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
Never!
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
There's no joy in it for me.
Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.
Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
You are not so sure that he'll come.
Why not -- ?
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
Jabez!
Jabez --
I'll get it, Jabez.
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
Don't be cross with him, Ma. This don't happen every day.
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
It shows on your face.
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
Wouldn't profit him none.
It don't matter!
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Mary -- Jabez --
Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
Of course not --
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
It's okay, it's okay.
So, why didn't you come?
That is Christmas music.
We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!
John.
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
The guy upstairs who's fucking things up?  I can give him to you.
Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!
Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
Only if New Jersey counts.
I'm a cop from New York.
They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
William Clay.  Call me Bill.
I told you...
We may have some problems.  How is your schedule?
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
When you're hot, you're hot.
The only thing left for them is the City Grid...  ...They may not do it.
I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.
Sure.  Follow me.
Oh...Where does he live?
Don't I always?
Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building, Hans?
Holly Gennero?
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
Yeah.  I remember our first date.
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
In my youth, partner.  In my youth.
You don't want to know.
I still feel like shit.
Ask the FBI.  They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it, step by step.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
Roy?
Bullshit.
Come on, nobody's gonna get hurt. If they were gonna shoot, they'd shoot now.
You men shoot, aim for the white meat!
Don't call yourself fat.
Well, how'll I get home?
It's okay... it's okay...
He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there?
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
I'm sorry...
You're really crazy.
How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story.
Who's on the phone, now?  What do you mean... throw it on you?  You knew it, right?
Are they on the phone still?
Well, then...
I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
I'm not alone.
I got Sal.
Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand?
Call me Sonny-boy.
Call me whatever you want.
I frisk you?
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
... armed robbery ...
When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
Come on, lemme load you up...
It's all we got.
Believe me, I'm on your side.
Gimme the traveler's checks and the register.
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
You seem like a likable enough guy. It's hard to judge.
Why not?
Yeah?
Everything's all right?  You okay?
What about Howard?
Girls, I wanta apologize.  For my language back there.
You were terrific, too!
Pure?
My body?  What for?
You're serious!
Fuck him - let him out!
Yeah - it's all right... let's go.
How'd that happen?
Does that still go?
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
Okay, when do I get them?
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
It's my mother.  Who needs this shit?
What can he do, he's clean...
I am.
I speak what I feel.
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
Oh.  Run.
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?
How much?
I've been training since I was twelve. Knives. Guns. Throwing stars. You name it... I can fight with it. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  Nothing scares me. I'm not afraid to die.

I fucked up. You can't help your greedy black lying ass from trying to get everything. All you've done is put a death sentence on Meeka.
I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
That's the rumor on the street.
This is your last chance. Tell us everything you know.
Nice to see you again, Edna.
Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!
Must you use that awful word?
Stop it.
I said stop it.
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
He used to date Pat Benatar!
I can certainly think of one more!
Wow. Laurence Harvey. He knew Frank Sinatra?  I knew Frank.
Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.

I'm trying to organize a boycott of Sal's pizza joint.  Ya see what I'm saying?
You got my back.
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
Did you ask Sal?
Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.
Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
We're still standing.
What makes Sammy run?
Wake up!
I just come home to take a quick shower.
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
What responsibilities?
One has nuthin' to do with the other.
Whew!

Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
Can ya dig it?
It's a motherfucking shame.
Talk to your son.
Where we goin'?
I wants my money.  I wants to get paid.
Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
My salary.  Two-fifty.
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
You keep it.
I can dig it.  It's gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
Your memory is really getting bad.
I can run out and get it.
Tina, it's not like that.
People are free to do what they wanna do.
What?
Gotta go.  See ya soon.  Everybody happy now?

Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
Since when do you know what's best for us?
Shaddup!  Jade, what can I fix you?
Tell Pino.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away.
Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.

Come over around seven.
Ooh gross.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
I'm fine.
Very good. Back in a jiff.
Of course, she's in on it too. Don't let her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has been doing. I'm staying here.

When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
Wanna bet?
Sucks for you.
Yea!
Yes.
What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
No. What happened?
A blimp.
Who?
Am not.
No. Look.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
I don't know who we are anymore.
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
Roger that, Wilco.
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Damn! What are the odds?
No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
No.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Not to expect you tonight.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.

Oh, go on.

Da pleasure be mine.
Tor!
No.  With hair, yah.  But I must shave head for wrestlink.  It scare da crowds.  Dey like that.
Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
You gotta be kiddin' me.
Who?
Because he's <u>my friend</u>.
So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
I did.  I established some tits and ass.
Oh.  Congratulations.
Not good...
No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
Okay?
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
Dynamite --
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
What's uncanny?
Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.
YES!  JUST DO IT!
So how long have you known Eddie?
Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run.
Don't worry, I'll teach you.
No you're not!  This marriage was never consummated.  I'm getting an annulment!
Isn't that the same thing?
Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.
Anything good?
No.
Al!
Al!!
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
She doesn't give a shit about him.
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
This guy.
Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
Really? They were..
Right.
Oh.
Oh my God!
He says --
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
And what did he come back now for?
What's the matter?!
Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him?
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
No.
She left.
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
Our foibles, our foibles!
Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
No, I mean...
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
Well, then I'm quitting.
I hear the dog really liked him.
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
Right.
Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
Yeah.
Well, when you put it that way.
All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
I missed you.
Oh yeah.
Really? 
Are you all right?
...yeah?
What?
Come on.
What are you drunk?
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there.
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
Oh, Jesus.
You brought the cameras here!
Please!
Yeah.
Save it.
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
Ed... I'm sorry.
Do you still have it?
What?... Why?
Thanks... That's ...
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
What kind of person?
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Yeah, just --
Dick.
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Right
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
As far as I know, they--
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president.
Hello, Tracy.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Yeah.
Yes?
I've got an idea.
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
Oh yeah, you bet.
Walt needs to see you.
Door was open.
I have proof.
No, I... uh, didn't know that
We'll let it run awhile
What do you mean?
Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.
I'm not like you.
Sorry.
Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.
Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.
Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
Are you sorry she's dead?
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
Yeah.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
Yeah.  But not for long.
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
Of course... But how?
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
What are you talking about?
Let my daughter rest in peace.
Stens?  Was it Stens?
Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
Yeah.  A great big one.
It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
Officer White, put down that weapon and --
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
Lynn.
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
Let's just kill them.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
<u>Lynn</u>.
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
I don't know him.  Mr...
He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
Against your code?
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
What little studio?
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
Susan Lefferts.
Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
Clean?
Until he gunned down six people.
They shot him in his library.
Nobody.  At least not yet.
Gone.  Not a trace.
Trashcan Jack.  The Big V.  I can tell you he's on the Night Train to the big adios.
Answer yes or no.
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter.
<u>Really</u>?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?
What's this all about, lad?
No.
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
What about you?
Just don't shoot me.
It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
What?
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
Of his penis, sir?
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
Not good enough.
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
I know how he feels.
Right now, before I back down.
None.  Call it a hunch.
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
Yeah, it's subtle.
What's he doing here, Sid?
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
What's wrong, Trash?
You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
Please hold, Sergeant...
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.
Oh Jesus.
Yes.
Who are you calling?!
When can you get it here?
Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.
It's a SAT-tracker.
They're spooks.
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
One-twenty.
How do you know so much?
Why'd you leave?
Looks like Detroit.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
<u>Here</u>?!
'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please.
You sure?
Those are Feds.
We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
How fast can you learn?
It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator's phone.
Oh my God.
Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
What kind of trouble.
Somebody took my blender.
No, sir.
To buy lingerie.
What do you mean?
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
"Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
Was that doctored-up, too?
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
My father's put me in touch with an attorney. He'll be--
Stacy--
That's gonna end tonight.
It's over.
Don't count on it.
Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
All right, look--
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
It's not me?
Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
We'd rather not--
My shoe?
Fuck off.
Good point.
L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
Mr. Dean--
Where's Stacy?
Can I open 'em up?
Really?
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
Bobby--
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
Yeah?
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
He got hit by a bus.
Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
It's hard to say for certain, these things are--
Fuck you.
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
We found the originals.
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
Hiding something?
Lyle?!
You're kidding me.
Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
Do you have visual?
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
Puffed cheese?
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
No.
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
I don't care to bargain.
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
Pardon?
I'm quite all right, thank you.
Yes.  Absolutely.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Good.
You don't sew at all!
It's a folk song.
It's a long song - Szerelem means loveand the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool.  For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave.  He sews her clothes, he worships the hem of -
That day, had you followed me to the market?
You will.  You will.
I know, darling, I'm sorry.
There you have me.
What?
I haven't, no.  Sorry.
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
What?
Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
Her hands and feet were tied.
What's the matter with you?
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
No.
I don't know.
So was my Patient.
So you can shoot a pistol?
You should be happy.  What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
I don't know what that means.
I liberated it.
She can take you as far as Florence.
And you've forgotten yours.
I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
Me?
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
Apprentices.
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
To arm-twisting.
Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!
Thank you.
I can already see.
Are you remembering more?
Are you crazy?
Yes?
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
Is something funny?
I've met you before.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
Yes.  Later.
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
No.  He's - no.
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
A toddler
Does he have to go?
What if you couldn't find him?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
I had a hotel room.
I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him.
Go away.
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almsy, who doesn't look up from his book.
Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
No.  I think I was a pilot.  I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin.  I was with them for some time.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
It's sold.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
I sincerely hope so.
You...you can't.
Well, no...but...
It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.
Got it.
I never carry...baggage.
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
In a week.
We're doing this together. We're partners.
You don't get the Mask code unless I go.
You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
One more item--not on the check list.
Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
To our...partnership.
Terrified. Still am.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
You're not on the beat.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
Shut up.
The Mask.
No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
It's your mistake.
There is no big job.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
Everything.
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
Right. The eight billion.
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
Surgically attached.
Get out of here!
You gave them the eight billion.
Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
This better be worth 1t.
You damn well thought wrong.
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
Thought you had to use some of these.
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
Who?
All of 'em?
Which one?
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records.  They kinda surprised me --
Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
Wow.  Why would they do that?
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Where's Anna?
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
It's not about working hard --
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
<u>No</u>.
I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
And that's what caused the contamination?
They skipped that step.
Show me the document that proves that.
Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
"Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
Perks?  Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?
Uh-huh.
Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
Take it.
Yesterday.
Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all of 'em.
Corey.
At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
Have you been to the water board?
Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
I'm gonna go live with George.
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
Better safe than sorry.
I'm gonna clean it up.
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
I didn't say that.
What do you want, a joke?
It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're the only one I trust them with.
Hunh-uh.  Not yet.  Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
Real early.  We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.
That's okay.  I understand.
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
Uh-huh?
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
You did?
You must.  Luke, look at me!
I'm cold ... so cold ...
You won't.
Growls a reserved greeting.
We're not out of this yet.
Barks and growls at his boss.
Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
What is it?
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
I'm going to see what it is.
Yes.
No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
Probably an asteroid field ....
How do I look?
Yes, you do.
Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
The entrance is collapsing!
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
A mining colony.
I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
I always said you were a gentleman.
Hyperdrive.
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
You may call me Leia.
Not really.
Thanks.
I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
Not yet.  They're working on it now.
What is it?
Closer?!
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
That is why you fail.
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
If it must be.  Yes.
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
Go on now. Do as I say.
He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
Where?
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
What's in it for me?
Don't lie to me.
I see your point. What's the favor?
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
What's the little black box do?
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
Having second thoughts?
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
So what does this thing do?
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
I'm here.
I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
Where'd they go?
We'll see.
Yeah, kinda.
Thank God.
Yeah.
--By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered!
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
Move aside!
I, the best knight in the world, bested! This is a great day, for my search is over. I love you, my King.
It is deep...
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
In the great book.
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!
And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
Ye...
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness.
You, my lord.
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.
One land, one king! That is my peace!
Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength.
To kill and be king, is that all?
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
Maybe the circuit is busy?
Why don't you let me?
What didn't he tell you?
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
No, she was heavily sedated.
No. Not at all,
What's her name?
Really? wow.
You're a nice man.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
She is going to be well?
No thanks Karl.
Fine thank you.
Depression?
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
Oh. What are you talking about for Christ sake! Did you see her or not? She's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or...
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
He didn't mention her.
That depends.
Why, I don't understand?
Could you see her?
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
Like what?
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
The closet
Yeah.
No you don't. I do it all the time.
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
Your not gonna marry him are you?
What?
So what's next?
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
I stole it.
Sure.
I've seen it.
You might loosen the straps then.
I'm not Regan.
If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
In time.
Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
Oh really, when?
No.
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
And also with you.
Her heart.
Don't listen.
What's this about?
I've seen him.
Yeah, a fall.
Who's in it?
I've seen it.
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Just a minute.
I don't know.
I don't know.
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
We have some lotion.
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
They're falling out.
Accident?
Two nights.
My pleasure.
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
I hate your kids, Frank.
You got weird kids, Frank.
Try the black Knable.
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
It's more than that.
No thanks.
So do I.
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
What?
Yeah, and what put him up there?
Talk.
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
It never was.
It's not gonna hurt you.
She's here.
I'll take my chances.
You wanna get a drink?
Yeah, fine.
Right.
We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
Yeah.
Fine.
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
What are you talking about?
Celebrating.  Join me?
Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
You're making things up, Frank.
I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
Twenty-eight years.
It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
What're you doing?
I'll take the Mallory.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
I can keep the beat.
Yeah?
I'm sorry?
We're finished.
We ran long.
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
That's the premise.
Am I missing something?
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
Switch?  What fucking switch?
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
Huh?
Uh, well ...
Job.
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
Baker.  Jack Baker.
Baker.
Downstairs.
He'll come around.
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
It's okay.  Last one.
In and out.
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
Hey, business is business.
Just dinner and dance, right?
Nothing.
How do you know?
Sure.
He called her.
Long story.
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
I didn't want to wake you.
Losing his teeth.
Another five years, huh?
Wow.
He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
Merry Christmas.
Huh? Oh, no.
I'm not much for sweets.
You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.
What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.
Let me have a look.
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
"Thanks?"  I guess they really did fuck you up.
Something good?
And you wouldn't be.
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
You said it, Jon, not me.
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was "titanically remote."  Who knows?  Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out.  Or maybe God really is on my side after all.  By the way, I know you don't get the papers in here.
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
Shoot him!
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
Janie?
I won't tell mom if you don't.
You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
What?
You can't blame me for trying.
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites.  How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ...
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
I'm not going anywhere.
Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.
You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.
Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
What about me?
Check...
Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
Maybe I dont say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
Is it...?
Hey, Im doing the best I can...  Id like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
Pretty much.
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we couldve been really good friends...
Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
Damn, you are the real thing...
Hey...
Everyone needs something.
Me?
Thats my car!  You stole my car!
You mean because you thought I was cocky Im now on a permanent acid trip?!!
Please.  Just tell me whats happening to me. In plain English.  None of that mumbo jumbo...
I asked you a direct question!  A glimpse of what?!
Why not?
Are we what, Jack?
It would help me if we were.
Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
Okay, chief.
For us, Kate.
No, youre right.  What are we doing?
Look, you dont understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
Pro bono.  You dont get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...
And...?
Do what?
She got those shoes...
Maybe youre not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldnt need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if thats what its gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids college fund.
Surprise.  Were pregnant...  Yeah...that mustve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
Sure.  I really like Annie.
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didnt we?
Thats my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
Sorry, Jack.  Its too important to me.
Its good, right?
Wait a minute.  Youre my wife?
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until its light out.
Think bigger.
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, Ill be fine...
Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
So we'll get egg nog.
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
Yes!
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
Relax, it's casual.
My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.
Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Yeah, nine years straight.
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you.
Victor did.
Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
And they're changing into...
Oh, it is.
Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad.
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
I think that thing is Ben.
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
<u>Girl</u>...?!
Dude.  That's my sister.
Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Hilarious.
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Never better.
Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
It's been changed.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
That's what we're here to find out.
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
I gave him twenty.
A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
It is.  There's something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you...
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
We must!
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
You may learn to like it.
Now I know...
Not now. We need air, not greetings!
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
Nothing -- against all that force.
Oxygenation...
"Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man..."
If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
At an operation?
Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.
Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
Two in a row?
Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
Sorry, but the situation has changed.
It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we're not going through it.  Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll remain in the Arterial System... until we reach the point of damage --  -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam. After the operation, we'll return by way of the Venous System --  -- until we reach the base of the neck --  -- where we'll be removed right here -- with a hypodermic.
Was there any damage?
Yes, by all means. We must try it.
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
What do you mean?
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
What's this, sir?
...What're you talking about?
What?
What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.
Geez. That's more'n I've heard you say all week.
Whoa, Daddy.
Jezhush.
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Personal matters.
Okay, Jerry. You're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, fuck it, let's take a look at that Ciera.
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
Oh, yah, I know that!
Where'd you get him that parka?
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Oh sure.
Uh-huh - in what way?
Mm.
Chaska.
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Uh-huh.
Yah, right -
Yah!
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
No! No cops! That's final! This is my deal here, Wade! Jean is my wife here!
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
Look, Jerry, you're not sellin' me a damn car. It's my show here.  That's that.
I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
Yah?
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
Yah...
Uh-huh.
Yah.
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
It's okay...
Anyone else residing there?
Yah, is this Marge?
Norm?
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
Yah?
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
Three-cent stamp.
It's terrific!
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
He's at Norstar.
Well... Why don't we...
The garden.  Take him there.  Move, people.  Let's do this!
I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Yeah, both of us.
You need to make these your primary "action items."
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
Dynamite?
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
I'll expose you.
A year?  How'd you manage that?
I don't know -- am I?
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
Marla?
Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
So you're staying in tonight?
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
It suits you.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Here.
No... no problem.
Whatever.
Chloe's dead.
What do you get out of it?
Can I come in?
Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we ever had sex?
I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
You are an insane person.
I can't let myself see where you're going.  Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...
Don't ask.
Yes.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
Pardon me?
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
How's that working out for you?
Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
Do what you like.
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
Yes, you can.
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
You get the idea.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
What car?
Any historical figure.
Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
No.  Not at all.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
You've gotta understand something about me.  I have a little rule, okay?  Don't ever talk to her about me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind of shit.
Uh... nah...
Look at your hand.
Fucking sweet.
An expired community college student ID card.  What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
Imagine how he feels.
What should I have told you?
Fight club was the beginning.  Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem.
You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
Answer me, Tyler.
I don't know!  Tell me!
And, sometimes you control it...
But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
This isn't possible...
What... what are you saying?
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
Um, well... technically, no.
I'm not going...
Stop finishing...
This is not about martyrdom.
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?
I quit.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. 
Very good, Sir.
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
Please, God, no...
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
I...I...
No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
Speed up.
I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...
Your entire world view just went out the window.  I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this.  I promise.
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
I've got to stop and help those people.
I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
...My Premonition was just like his.
It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
That's crazy.  You can't give up now.  We can still fight this thing.
How does a nice mature fuck sound?
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
What feeling?
I'm... really sorry.
Thirty-nine.
We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.
I wish you were on the plane!
I don't.
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
You're the fuckin' devil.
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
"Next?"
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
You saying Tod did kill himself?
Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
Huh?
Put it in the guard's barracks.  Man they got pissed.  They beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run around.
Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...
Ninety.
Show me how it operates.
Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
Where's your stuff?
No.
That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
There are no worse places.
Fermented fish sauce.
Yes.
It means "virgin."  My mother was comedian.
Where's his father?
Huntington Beach, California.
You think you are... .
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
We just take pictures?
That's right.
Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.
I know.
Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
Yeah.  Big time.
This just occurred to somebody, now?
Meeting ... people.
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
Really?
The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
Why this is outrageous!...
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
Well, what the hell does that mean?
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
<u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
Thanks.
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
I'm... just looking for Parry...
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
Where?  Maybe we can.
I'm a man with a mission, Jack.
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
Well..um...you get an official membership card...  Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry?  You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...
I know a great place.  ...UH...WARREN!
Great place huh?
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
<u>What</u>!?
I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
Fifty dollars?
Can I take you to lunch?
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
So what? You going to help me?
You're totally gone, aren't you?
Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
Who?
Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
It sounds exciting.
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
Oh... You mean you don't want to.
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
I'm not some piece a crap.
I love it.
Shut up! All of you!
I don't know.
Fill it up.
Where are you going?
I didn't get it, did I?
No. How much do I owe you?
Would you like to talk to the manager?
Hi, Tita.
Now don't...
Don't, then.
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
You know who it once belonged to?
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Yeah, me, too...
A couple of months.
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
I guess you fell in the water.
That's dangerous, you know.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
What would I do with it? Run amok?
Then after that?
I gave it a second thought.
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
At being a fake.
That's what you said?
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
Will you let me talk to you, please?
Is she?
Thanks, Carl...
What?
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
It's a Borzoi.
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married...
In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
Steam.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Aaron, how you doin'?
Victor.
Wussup.
Um. Yeah! Shorty!
I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.
Of course.
I did.
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
She fucks it all up!
Which one?
She lives near Eddie?
Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
How old is he?
You gonna talk to him?
Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.
Yeah.
Wha'?
A girl named Amanda.
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
She didn't say she had no man.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
Wha'?
Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off --
By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
They didn't do anything.
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
Can I ask anybody now?
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Your aunt?
Joan or Margaret Smith.
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
Just relax....
Breathe easy...
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
Where am I?
Thank you.
I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
You may be right.
Wait a second --
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
Come on in.
Since he moved to L.A.
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
Course he has. That's his wife.
Where are you going?
You sure did.
What are you doing here?
Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?
I know.
Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.
What's that?
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
Come inside.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Sure, all drifters do.
Take it where?
Sure.
Can I steal you for a minute?
You've met her?
John! You used to fly together!
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
I have this effect on lots of women.
You are a rich woman.
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Depends on the question.
Yeah.
Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
That's what I want to know.
What does all this mean?
I think you better sit down.
You shouldn't be here.
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
I recommend it.
Very good, sir.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
I'd say charcoal.
Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope.
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
Utah?
What about finding the source?
But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
Not really?
Frieda's boss.
In a minute!
No, I ain't got you...
Who's your decorator?
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
What did these Vancouver factories do?
Thanks, I needed that.
Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
Great pipes.
No prob...
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.
Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
Spooky.  I'll process her.
What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
You gave it to the girls for one.
Fluck you!
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.
But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
No, wait...
I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?
I'll mail you a letter, come on!
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
Why am I what?  Excuse me?  I catch you saying the F-word again.  I'll kill you.  That's a fucking promise.  Now get the fuck out of here.
Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Shut the heck up... Pop.
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
Let me go out like a man.
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Golly, I'd probably faint.
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
Are you okay?
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
Julian, you're fired.
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Only on a first name basis.
Hey, the poet...
Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
It is to us!  It's computerised.
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
No. 
I wasn't looking.
Goodbye.
Encore du sho ping!
Avec a tu pourras le supporter.
Mmm.
Where from?
What's he do?
Yeah, I know.
Where the hell is it?
Morning.  Sometime.
Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.
Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.
The other guy's a frog too.  Checked in at the Edison.  Had a hooker sent up.
Third time around.
Whatta you got?
Just for mistakes of parking?
Why is it called Hellgate?
I been damn careful up to now.
I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
You remember Mary Finelli?
Nicky Moore.  Patty Ryan.  Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you, asshole?  Julia Sullivan!  She mean anything?  She means something to me!
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
Elvis has left the building.
Hey, bud.
Well, why not a little of the King?
You alright?
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
Okay...
Frank...
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that.
Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
Do you know where I found this?
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
What'd you just say?
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Johnny...?
Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
Fire.
You're the voice of an angel, Johnny.  If you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever made it.
She's not here.
October 22, 1969.
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
You there?
H-hi.
Yeah, I think so...
No.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
In my pocket.
What...
Okay, okay...
We did it, John.  We stopped him.
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my Dad.
The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
Longbranch...?
Yeah.  That's it.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
Uh, huh.
I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
I try to be.
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
A hot shot, huh?
Talk about dumb luck.  Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  Bets part is she's the first victim.  She knew the doer.  I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
Cool it, Andy.
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
I'll think of something.
Barely.
Why?
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
Somebody was in here.
You're Shelly?
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
May be please have the wallet.
Maybe.
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
Damn you, Shelly!
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
Who's Horace?
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
I wish it was.
Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
I could swear I heard...
It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
Okay.  There's one.
Come and get it.
There was this monster.  He was after me.  He wanted to kill me.
Nancy.
No more.
I found it outside.
We'll scare 'em right back.
Boy scouting.
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
There's no time for this bullshit...
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
-- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
I need to talk to you.
It's going.
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
Okay, I'll call you later.
N...nothing.
Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
That's what I'd like to know.
For a good reason.
Her name's Stephanie.
I was going to, I was going to tell everyone.  I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  Is Steven around?
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
Okay.
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
What are you going to do?
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
This is Jason's fault!
They're out of town.
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
No, I think it's just the beginning.
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
I'm staying.
I...I can't...
Really?
That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
Yeah...a lot.
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
But I didn't get you one...
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
What do you mean???
Is the ship going to sink??
I'm not!!
Please, hurry...
Where you're going, mister?
I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
You are going where?
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
Alla puttanesca.
I don't want to hear about it.
Shut up, Elliot.
She wants a divorce.
Asbestos lining.
You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
Do not inhale.
Then you should carry a gun.
Where is it?
We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
Keep going west. Last building before the river.
Yes. What are you implying?
This could be it.
This could be it.
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
We don't even like each other, do we?
The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
Except I won't have a father anymore.
Packs an emotional wallop.
What's sexy?
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
It's your best play, Nicky.
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
How prominent?
I'd forgotten that.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
She's my gynecologist.
I'm glad we're having this talk.
Right here. At the door.
Get yourself something to eat.
I lost it. I lose everything.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
So what are you going to do about it?
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
That's a simple subject.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
This could be it!
Why does it matter?
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
hat was this morning.
Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
Burnt sienna.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.
We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
A little.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
I don't know.
Someone waiting for you?
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
I'm going home to my machine.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
One more.
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
A -- a week.
I thought you were against fighting.
We must end the campaign.
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
I hope not.
Well, I've called you here because I've had a chance to see the new legislation. It's exactly what was rumored. Arrest without warrant. Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious...
There is nothing I can give.
I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr. Baker.
No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
Thank you. No.
Very well.
Yes, sir. The day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of "Free India." Then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt.
Who's leading them?
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
He's "discovering" India.
If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
It's for the best.
Now is your chance to find out.
Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
I'll see what I can do.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
Often.
We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards.
Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
You had to be a right-hander.
You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
--What car?--Go to sleep.
I'm proud of you, Vincent.
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
Michael's.
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
I'd have to bleach my hair.
How tall are you?
Why not?
They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.
Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
Those checks take forever.
Come on.
That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
There's a problem, Lamar.
No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>.
Not like <i>this</i> one.
Antonio--
This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
I get my own help.
Get it over with...
It looks fine.
Yeah.
It's all right.
You were asleep.
But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.
Usually on the right side as you go in.
My mind's not on guessing games.
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
He might be ready to chop us up.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
What do we do?
And switched keys.
I can handle it.
I think you liked it with him.
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
Yeah.
I don't want to hear it.
You want to try with me?
I don't see how.
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
If they are not here, he must have sent them away.
Who was it?
Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
No, I'm afraid not.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
What about the vault?
Whatever you need.
Just sandwiches...
He took the day off.
I kinda doubt it.
How about twenty thousand?
Just... tell us what you want.
A Ford... We have a Ford.
After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...
I Just want to find a suitcase.
The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
'Good.'
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
What about?
Yes.
Jack...
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
That's nice.
I can't.
He was all right to me.
Nicer than most.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Who?
Really?
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
Nasty.
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
You've been watching the film.
Shouldn't think so.
Yeah.
I left last year.
Working at Woolworths.
What?
Nobody seems to know.
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
Who's Brumby?
Yeah.
No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
You sure?
No. Really, I am.
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
Ta-ra.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
What, and get myself beaten up again?
Not much.
And that'll make me feel better?
No. I'm visiting relatives.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Still got a sense of humour?
Can't say I do.
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
Piss off, Ray.
Yep.
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
Shut up.
They do that up North.
You're bluffing, you bastard!
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
Three hundred altogether, Harry.
That's right.
I'm not?
I had to.
They killed the goose.
No.
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
That's right...
That's the truth...
What?
How?
Huh.
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
No, we're just...
Talking about it as a...
No.  Not actually.
Did you talk to Graff?
You're saying "me."
Yes.
Yes.  I'm sure.
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
That's right.
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
How ya doing?
What?  You can't do any what?
Huh?
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
They stole the...
Down the street.
No.
No.
Why?
Do you understand?  My stuff is mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm taking half of his commissions-- now, you work it out.
The leads come in, I'll let...
Please don't leave.  I'm going to talk to you.  What's your name?
Levene!
You call them again.  Mr. Williamson...!
Could I...
And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
Not lately it isn't.
Murray...
Murray said...
Murray said...
And what if you don't close.
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
Now.  Yes...When?
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
I can't split them.
Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
Yes, I am.
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
Uh-huh?
Mmm.
I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
No, I don't think so, Shel.
No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.
Fuck you.
Eighty-two thousand dollars.
That's right.
"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
From the store.
Bruce..."I don't want to fuck around with you.  I don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this.  I do, too.  I came here to do good for you and me.  For both of us.  Why take an interim position? 
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
Sure.
Uh...
No, his wife is.
Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
Mmmm...
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
I'm not.
If we wait till Mon...
It's not me, it's my wife.
You tell me again.
What does that mean?
The power to negotiate.
This.
Not to my knowledge, no...
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
I'm going home.
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
You did?
If you don't want it, give it back.
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
John...
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
That's right.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
I got surprises for everybody!
You're not my father!
Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
A hundred years...it's a toast.
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.
Let's go.
You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
Mio fratello.
I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
You know otherwise, Freddie?
What's that?
What is it?  Can I help?
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
Am I a prisoner?
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
Twenty-five this time.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
That's my brother.  Nothing could get him away from that two mule town.  He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
Very well.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
Yes, Michael, it does.
It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.
Have Tom Hagen meet me in the Harbor House.
Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
Goodbye, Michael.
The baby I lost...
It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out!  It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil.  I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world.  An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
There was this kid that I grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know.  We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street.  Things were good and we made the most of it.  During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too.  I guess as much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town.  Someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order.  When I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things.  So when he turned up dead, I let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. I never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business.
So?
I deny his every charge.
I do not.
I do not.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
No, she's here.
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
Maybe, yes... maybe no.
That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
I won't keep you another minute...
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
I didn't mean to...
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
He is dead now, twenty years.
No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
I put him to bed.  He's not there?
But I didn't do this!
Just that I was in the Marines.
No.  Iced tea's fine.
But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
Huh?
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
I'm not wearing an undershirt.
All right, I guess.
Go ahead.
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
Do you miss it?
I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
You asked me to model.  Remember?
You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
Do I look okay?
If that's okay?
David produced her last picture.
Run for what?
Do I have any other choice?
I see.
What won't do?
You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
Ooooh.
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
You only embarrass yourself.
More your line.
Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
Of course.
Oh dear.
Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
One likes to live simply.
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
Of course.
Head.  Not heart.
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
No, but you dress like an asshole ...
My version of "take this job and shove it..."
Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
Kip.
Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
Needs brightening ...
Good.
That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...
C'mon, man ...
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
There's no one left ...
one minute -- !
No ... And they won't take my calls ...
Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...
NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.
You've been pre-booked...
Yeah... You want a ride...
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
What am I supposed to do?
Hello, Memphis --
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
What do you got ... ?
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
I can handle it --
I can handle it --
Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
Otto called -
What?
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Things are all leafy and suburban ...
Run it...
A distinction worth noting ...
I understand -
Hey -
Deodorant.
I think so... They're just... So ...
You're going high-cheese, dude --
Woo-woo-wooooo!
No worries ...
Yeah ... You -- ?
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
No more shines, Billy.
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
I'm in construction.
That again.
Jezuz Christ!
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
I got seared.
There are cops all over the place.
Yeah.
Done.
Will you stop.
You're some fucking jerk.
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
No, no. It's okay.
It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
But, Paulie, please.
That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
Suck my cock!
Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
How you doin'?
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
Well, I don't have no trousers on...
I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way.  Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that--
Yeah, it is.
And all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG, "I'm sorry." BANG!
And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
I told you, I just got change.
I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
Allegedly, what I am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now.
Good, it was all right.
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
Seven.
Somethin's in my room.
It's touching me.
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
--But--
What're those?
It's an integer proof.
Half-red, half-black--
Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, Will Hunting.
I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
It's Saturday.
Find out what?
I did.
Not at all.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
I do.
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
Hold on!
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
Come in.
I don't know. India maybe.
I don't got a crush on her.
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free.
How about the ones on that shelf?
What did you think?
No.
You've never been on a plane.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
I guess.
Define that.
Yeah.
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
I didn't want the job.
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
--No, have you had any experience with that?
Cause fuck him, that's why.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
What?
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
So you just want to use me and go?
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
Yes you were.
Pretty boring, I guess.
You know, nothing special.
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
Not a chance.
I'm supposed to understand this.
They don't come over here that much.
Not tonight.
Fine.
I guess so.
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
Yeah, but how do you know?
And you're sure about that?
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
What the fuck am I afraid of?!
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
I never cared about that.
Goodbye.
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
I'll get Rosasharn.
You're *ticklin' me!*
Naw. They paroled me.
Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
What'd he look like again?
Okay. Go on.
Why, I guess so.
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
Goodnight.
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
Just around that next bend.
I don't know.
I aim to.
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
I ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this.
No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I hadn't tol' you.
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
All but me! I'm a-stayin'.
And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do.  And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even, I ain't a- goin' to California!  This here's my country. I b'long *here*.  It ain't no good--  --but it's mine.
Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
No plants.
Okay. I be back a little later.
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.  That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
Maybe that's jus' what he done.
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
I'd a found you, Ma.
Sometimes they do.
Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty.
Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
Don't know--but it's better'n this.
He was a good man.
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
That's what I asked you, ain't it?
They come. They come and pushed me off.
Won't they come out here?
We gonna stay, ain't we?
I wisht it was day.
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.
I'm Martin Blank.
Whatever I can get away with.
Then express yourself, Bob.
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
Not much else.
Where have I been?
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
Bad people.
As long as I get the laugh.
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
--She's not dead---
Like love?
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
I just know.
They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."
What stuff?
Okay.
Up on the right.
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
No harm no foul.
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
Hey, Bob.
Those all seem kind of related...
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
He using her.
If he does our job, he's our job.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
I've looked at it.
That's wonderful, Mom.
Nature made him then broke the mold.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
Work's good for the soul.
See you in ten years.
Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer.
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
Does Chicago count?
A jogger, huh?
I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
Annie!
I don't care! We'd be together.
I can't do this. I can't leave you...
Why?
Fine.
I didn't know I had to.
You were never thirteen, Mom.
What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
Don't they believe in signs here?
If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
Why? There's no food in the house?
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
Well, now you know what it feels like.
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
Exactly...
Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
Hi.
That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
Tch. What are you --
Okay.
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
She will if you think she should.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
Okay.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
Take your time.
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
What do you mean?
We have a business manager. The best around.
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
She calls him Tommy...
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Oh, how sweet.
Promise?
You too, Diane.
I understand, but Annie, please...
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
What?
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
I don't think Warren would go for that.
He thought it was a ghost.
You're catching on.
No!
We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
No, I'm just not that hungry.
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
You just showing off for her!
You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!
I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
Dragon book. Compiler design.
Shh!
The sensitive type.
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
Again?  Yeah sure.
I want it.
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run.  I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look...  "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers!
Hmmm.
No. No one special.
I told you, I don't play well with others.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!
Joey's getting stupid busy.
We did it!
Yeah! Sure.
I said give me time.
You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
Are you challenging me?
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
I know, I know who wrote it.
I'll hack the Gibson.
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
Yeah.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
Joey, Joey...
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
What, it left a note?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
Congratulations.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
You don't owe me anything.
What does that mean?
Get back!
Go!
Yes, sir.
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
You guys always look great.
It's okay..it's okay.
Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?
How do you know their not?
I can see this is useless.
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.
No way. No how.
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
He's coming to get me Rachel.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
You knew. You just didn't care.
Don't you mean what you do best?
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
I don't know.
Its not over yet.
No problem, Sheriff.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
What are we doing?
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
He's here, Sheriff.
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
He's been here.
Yes.
It isn't a man.
Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs.  Brady, you know how to use a gun?
Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name.
What's going on?
Don't touch him Jamie!
Huh?
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
Annie!
I can't.
He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
Come with me.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
Will you call me tomorrow?
Lee Brackett.
I'll be here.
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
I don't think so...
Have a good time.
Why are they under there?
Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?
I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
There is no such thing.
Tommy, let me in!
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
Are there any special instructions?
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
What does that mean?
He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."
Come in, come in.
Oh.
You want to see some?
A lot of works.
Oh, it's magnificent!
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
We're actresses.
I cry at the opera.
Uh-huh.
Yes.
This time I really think I have something.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
Yeah.  It's kind of a weird place, actually.  A lotta wall space. 
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
Hi.
Well, are...are they big?
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
Oh, great.
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Yes?
Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
No, I don't have time.
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
Everything's okay? 
Oh, that's nice.
Yes, he's just adorable.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Oh, my God.
Oh, all the time.
No.
Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.
Aren't they great?
I know!  I know!
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
Are you in love with someone else?
Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
You're not lost.
Get his wine away.
Oh, honey!
But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. 
Mmm...
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
No.
Yeah.
Oh...
Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
I know, I know, and your hamster.
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
I think we need to eat.
Huh?
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
Football!
Is there no chance?
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
Right.  We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...
True.
Oh, sure.
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
Here.  Be careful with those.
Oooo.
Really?
Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money. 
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
You're grateful, but you resent me.
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
Yeah.  Me, too.
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
How are you?
Well, I hope you've changed.
Probably not.
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
I am.  You-you made my day.
It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
Okay.
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
Mmm, what?
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
God.
I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
...read it over, and think about it.
...you don't have to think.
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
I have not read you your rights.
I hereby acknowledge that...
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?
Now, whyn't you help us?
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
I'm not.
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
~Don't shoot, G-Men..."
M'I gonna see you tonight?
Then I'm doing fine.
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
Impossible.
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
...are you alright, sir...?
...Let's see the pigs, please.
Somewhere in Italy.
Waal, Nobody's <u>Perfect</u>... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
No.  And...
The children...?
Exactly.
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
...young boys, still...?
Let the girl go.

...what's he got against you?
...standard issue...
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
Well, well, well, well, well, she went <u>in</u> there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, <u>without</u> the Felon, with<u>out</u> the gun...
And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
I think its meaning is clear.
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
...should love to correct your error. 
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
...your <u>scar</u>..?
I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
Take mine.  Ah. And is that your <u>wife</u>...  Signora.  Can it be that you are lovelier, even, than at our last encounter...?
Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
She my foster.
Sir, with all due respect....
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
...but will that satisfy you?
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
You're <u>free</u>...
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
Yeah, but who would marry friendless <u>me</u>...  Howabout you, Romeo...?
The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.
Why?
...and that is what you need to expand.
Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
...what did you want? 
What shape is the scar?
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
Brazilian. 
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
....that's right.
I don't <u>think</u> so.
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
That's right.
What is your point?
When?
Because?
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
They wouldn't be a bit surprised..
Uh, yeah, that's...wow.
Man, it's not like I don't know about women. I had this babysitter...
"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
I'm not a nai-ive little...
Hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up!  Isn't Fun great!
We need more ritalin. Can't we just grind it into the munchkins' food?

Hey--that coffee?  You're a goddess. Gimme, gimme...So what you gals talk about?
Don't be. Don't be sorry for your thoughts. They make me...react. I don't know...all I know is that I can't go through another summer where I <u>almost</u> did something.
Hey, don't run away now.
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
Like last night, Veronica?
All right.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Because you're an idiot.
Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
You goddamn bitch!
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
No.
Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
Uh-huh.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
I didn't. Cherry.
Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.
You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
Next channel, darling.
Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.
Oh.
Of course.
Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?
Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
No-o!
What?
Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
Goddamn Geek!
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
What's that?
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
Come on through.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
Have a nice outing, you lot.
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.

You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
But she'll have no one to look after her!
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
Open this door!
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.

Thank you so much!
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!

I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.

This . . .
It's so beautiful!
That idiot boarder?
I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
That was what we were led to believe . . .
Yes . . .
I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.
I'm stumped.
Bull...
You just made that up.
Just get better okay?
How much time off?
Where's Allison?
What's that?
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
Where is she? Where is my wife?
Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
I don't work here.
Ambulance.
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:
I surrender...
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
Try stupid.
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.
Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
Mister LaPlante...
Mister LaPlante...
'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is why.  I'm broke, plus I got legal problems... Nobody was asking for me, huh?
You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
Down.  You mean jail?  For that credit card stuff?  For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer...
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
Were you in it?  In the war?
Bodybuilding!
John, I know all about it.
I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!
This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
Unprofessional.
WHAT?  THEY FOUND WHAT?
You were in bed.  Weren't you?
What's "cynical"?
You didn't?
An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
So this really does the trick, eh?
Let's watch some TV.
Well, it's for a woman.
It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
You're responsible for your own actions and you don't mean to hurt anyone.  In other words, you've done <u>your</u> best.  I'm saying don't carry the burden of <u>other</u> people's actions on your shoulders, because they're beyond your control.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
Sure.
Just show me the way.
Isn't that always the way?
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
About us.
'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
I'm thirsty.
Did Daddy tease you?
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
What's that?
Damn.
What?
Huh?
<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
Yeah -- she did a good job.  This glass looks brand-new.
Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
Oh, honey.
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
What for, dickweed?
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
Oh really?  <u>You've</u> been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
And I can't help having a cold.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Even cosier.
Thank you -- how efficient of you.
Yeah -- how'd you know that?
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
Maybe he was a lousy shot.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
That is what bothers me.
And what do you think you will find in another land?
Then it's worth the journey.
For what?
We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
No.  What am I to do?
It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Why not?
A lucky guess.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
I don't know anymore.
You look like you have.
I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.
Why?
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
No.
I do not know -- and even if I did...
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
That's what the Kurgan said.
It will not end tonight.
I can take care of myself.
I don't know.
Me too.
I love you, Conner.
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.
I'll make the call.
<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
You won't die if you let me help.
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
How about the cop?
I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
They'll cut the power.
I don't know.
You fucked up, Glen.
You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.
I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
Yeah.
I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
That's okay.  I love you anyway.
That big asshole nailed my windows.
Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help the police!
How about dog shit?
Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
Another minute.  Please --
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
Goddamned small town bullshit.
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
Yes, sir.
Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
How do I reach him?
You can let go.
I guess we do.
What do you mean by that?
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
Let me explain.
I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
Their people?
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
I can't, I don't have the men.
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
Satellites?
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
I'll be over.
Get in.
Listen, you need me.
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
Take the river road back. It is clear.
We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
What is it?
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
Promoted. House Manager.
This goes out live?
Why sir?
Call, sir?
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
I will see what I can do.
I will give you my house.
The third floor are low class rooms.
Yes, with Fedens and the children.
I couldn't help.
Jean Baptiste!
Where are you hurt, son?
Get in.
It will do just fine.
So where is the lamb?
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
What sort of car?
I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.
Please do not talk like this.
Why?
I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
Thank you, Roger.
Go downstairs, I will help you.
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
C'mon.
Is she alright?
Three times, to be exact.
I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
Nothing.
The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father...
Left, goddamnit!
The...Fourth of July.
Up here --
Prove it.
I thought she was dead. For sure.
I'm better than that.
Why?
Most fun I've had all day.
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
He's gotta still be down here.
He's dead...?
We're safe?
Jesus!
Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
I hope not.
How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
You're hurting me.
-- the sadistic prick --
Where is she?
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
Steven??
What?
I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
What?
I am.
Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
-- no more --
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
What's going on?
Why not?
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
Oh, dear.
What will they tell you?
Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
Sure.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
She's down...how do you mean honey?
Where is she?
Sure.  Did you see the others?
He's blessing the house.
For good luck honey.
Aubrey run! Aubrey stares in horror at Maura - just then the knife FADES AWAY as Maura rolls over, returned to normal -
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
You didn't think much about that before.
What?
It was in the cellar.  Weird.
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
I think everything's ready.
She's gone!
Aubrey!
No...  NO!
I'm all right...
If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
White meat will be fine...
I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
Thank you.
Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us.
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
What?
Well what is it!
Jesus Christ ...
Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
And what is ... this frozen moment?
I don't know ...
Where?
Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
That's great.
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
I'll do it!
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
Would you know this store again?
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
I'm sorry.
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
It has already begun.
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
It was so beautiful!  When the blanks went off, they...
Gum.
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.
Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have to change them.  "Witchcraft." What's the running time?
No need.  Guards' station's right there.
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
Why try?
Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?
Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
Anna, I think you better stay....
"But we'll be the same as we started...
Too-do-loo, babe.
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....
Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb...
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
Yeah.  The big E.
He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  But he knew Right and Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed around...
A little petting is not the issue!
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...
Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.
You re not "some guy" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I....
This is too bad to be false.
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
I guess that's a no.
Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....
Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
Alchemy.
Too bad.
No.  But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?
Tell me about it...
The Hudswinger!
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
I'm happy enough.
Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat...
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
I know they're gonna buy that stock --
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
Why yes, do you know it?
Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
-- or lack thereof?
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
You don't say.
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
Phony, huh?
He grins wolfishly.
I'm sure you do.
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
...Geez.
I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
Get up!
We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
Norville.
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
Well, why don't ya read it.
Well, I made the dean's list.
Lobby. We haven't got all day.
Damnit, where's my car!
Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
...Her mother needs an operation...
He don't look wise.
She is!
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
Alive?
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
You don't believe in it?
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
Is she a doctor?
I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
I guess I'll wait until I'm home, Mrs. Rand.
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
No.  You're quite wrong.  Right here's the seat of the trouble. Mrs. Holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people.  It's revived all their old superstitions -- Zombies -- and that sort of nonsense.
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
Why shouldn't she be?
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
Hmm. Good night.
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
Elena, what are you're talking about?
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
All right.
Good.
Hnnn.
Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
Sure dad.
Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?
Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
It was lovely!
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
It'll warm you up.
It's not a bother.
Educated guess.
Yes, it was -- I ended up --
All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned.
Do what?
Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
Moisture! Moisture!
Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place.
Hey, it's a sellable skill.
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
Who said so?
I don't have a girlfriend.
Sure, anything but this English.
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
I don't know.
Huh?
Watching what?
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
With who?
Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
Charles, what time is it?
The ones you built?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
Communist Viet Cong.
I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.
What's that, then?
I had him!
Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute!
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
Why?
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
What I saw?
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
Has her books in it.
I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
First I need a copy of the key.
That's right.
Even the best make mistakes.
But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
Huh?
Ran like hell to go to him...
You're not missing much.
Who?
I didn't want to kill her, Will.
No back-up.
Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
Surely you know the one who made you...
Your lover.
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
Yes... My God...
I can't save her.
Louis, I swear I did not.
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
Sit still. It's not finished -
He'll never let us go.
It is! Take the back stairwell -
Claudia, you torture yourself.
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
Be still!
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
That's not so.
You really believe that?
Yes...
Give it to me!!!
But why do you want me?
Yes...
Dying?
We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
But how do you know?
I can't.
Paris? You came from Paris?
But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...
Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know.
I don't pretend to know.
Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
CLAUDIA!!!
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
I tried...
Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
You're not lying to me, are you?
Can a vampire feel love?
How could I not? She had to know.
Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
But it has. There is no more to tell.
No...
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
No.
They never found the body.
You're okay. Thank god.
Why are you being like this?
It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
Wait, it's Nancy --
I'm fine.
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
It's...him.
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
I'll talk real slow.
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
We gotta get out of here. Now.
I don't know, but I'm starving.
How much?
Not anymore.
And so could you -- crazy fool.
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
What is up with that weirdo?
How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
May life be good to you both. As for the others  they will be quiet here  and I will be with them.
Good winds and bad winds!
I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
No.  She shall not be left here.
M~ father will take care of it.  Pappa is wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe.  I could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
She has never mentioned her family.
No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
Thea is an orphan.
What an odd question!
Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
But one must love a father.
You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you - I'll warn them against you.
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
Maybe you've got the wrong crypt  after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
We have no time for that.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
All right  all right.
I'm hurrying.
Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
Merry Christmas.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
I said I wish I'd never been born.
Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.
Our clothes are dry.
No.
Made what?
Oh, well, I can't . . .
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
Well, naturally. Of course.
Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
George Bailey.
Not a soul.
Well, wait and see.
Hiya, George!
Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab.
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
All right.
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
When'd you see him last?
That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Nice girl, Mary.
Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Well, she's not crazy about him.
No.
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
Yes  charge.
Aw, get going!
Don't hurt my ear again!
Hope you enjoy it.
Look, Nick. What's wrong?
What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox.  Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come here!
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Oh, wait. Wait . . . Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
She was here first.
Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
What is it  a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
You may kiss my hand.
In that place?
Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
Have you made up your mind?
About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
Mary . . .
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
Thanks for dropping around.
My baby.
Lassos the stork! You mean you . . . What is it, a boy or a girl?
Going up to see Zuzu.
I've eaten.
I don't care. It's George's tux.
What plates?
Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
What?
Oh, shucks . . .
What the hell.  For you....
How fast is enough?
Soon, dark eyes, soon.
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
They're moving pretty fast.
Yeah.
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
We're hung up on something.
Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
Let's just go sailing, okay?
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
No!  It's still there!
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
What camera?
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
You can't stop me.
No place special.  Just hanging out.
You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
Not till next year.
Pop.  I'm sorry.
At least you're safe.  What about the others?
Sean's still out there.
You said something about a camera.
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Is that what it is?
My ass!
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
So there's one around here.
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
Why?
Home it is.
Mrs. Silvera.
It's good with coffee.
What're you guys doing today?
Terrific.
He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
We have to do something.
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
Two of them are still missing!
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
Someone has to do something.
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
No.  Find your brother, okay?
It's all right, we're okay.
Ready?
Help!  Help!
That's a crock of shit.
None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
Shut up.
Huh?
Next week.
Double nope!
What Kids?  Who went out?
I'm going.
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
I'm not sure I can.
No.
Coming about....
When are we going out?  You and me?
You always go with Andy.
Yeah.
Okay, okay.  Close your door.
Forget it, he won't listen.
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
With those camera lights and...
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
I know, but you're just going to have to find another way.  So you better start.
Yeah.  Down there.
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
Yes.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
Let's not talk about that now, okay?
I talked you into this?
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
I know I can capture it.
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
Yes?
How's your patient?
Me, too.
So tell Calvin.
Well, that's why you got it.
I don't understand.
I want that shark, Kathryn.
I'm  fine.
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
Make this quick!
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
So do I, love.
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
Why are you?
So do I.  But for different reasons.
And here I thought I was charming you.
Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
And big for his age.
He's missing.
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
The one that goes underwater?
No, think of something else.
He's diving!
SEAN!
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
What?
It's disappeared.
Precisely.
Hey, I don't want to hear.
Buzz off.
Polar bears in Georgia???
Oh...
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
It's not closing, Mike.
Right, Mike.
Sharks???
It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
Nowhere....
It sure is....
It went away....
How could you do that?  Your own daughter....
I don't know....
I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.
I'm not on vacation....
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
I'd be afraid of losing....
It's beginning....
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
Stop what?
I'm not doing anything.
You check it....
Mommy lets me....
I'm just getting started....
He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
Where do I pull off...?
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
No, you're not....
Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
You'll be sorry.
I'm sorry...I....
I do....
Yes I can....
You got a better idea...?
She said it was coming....
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Get her started....
Aye, aye, Captain....
What's that....?
All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....
Tell Thea I'm sorry....
We'll be done pretty soon....
Stop busting my hump....
The readings suck....
I made them, man....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
Put me down, damnit....
What?
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
What?
You think he's not good enough for her?  You're right.  If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.
Maybe the gear crapped out....
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
Anybody ever tell you you're nuts....
Don't flatter yourself.... 
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
Anything to do before I go home?
Good night, Polly....
What?
Yeah?
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
Is it your vehicle?
Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
O.K.
Not too good in daylight ..
Because, don't get into it ...
A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
<u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
No, you didn't.
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
Listen to me saying what?
Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
I'm asking it.
Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
Bits.
You ain't going in alone?
I thought it was Taylor's case?
I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
That's bullshit,
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
<u>If</u>, your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for <u>one</u> out of <u>two fucken seconds</u>, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago ..
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
My hands?
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
It was probably the wind.
There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.
He said that? What else did he say?
I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..
Even better.
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I meant something else.  When do you want to leave?
Let's go.  I'll drive you. _ 45.
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
Could you just stop moving?
Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm. _ 65.
I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
I see what you're saying.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Oh come on --
Hmm.  Pretty good.
My son... my mind...
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
Same to you.
We are?
Thanks.
Yeah, thanks.
What you wrote inspired me. _ 79.
Plus, you could use that commission.
Oh good.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Bye you guys. _ 88.
Easy, easy --
Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
He's in the living room asleep.
At eleven at night? _ 70.
Good.
I'll give it everything.
I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella.
Now you want Arizona dollars.
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
I gotta get back to Cushman.
I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
No.
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
I came here to let you go. _ 27.
I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
-- and I'll get 'em.
Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
Right up ahead, buddy --
I'm scared.  What is it?
That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
One way to find out.
It is truly, whats the word? Inspiring.
Oh, don't worry about that.
Just drop it Paul!
I filmed this the morning they left.
I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?
You couldn't have made that jump.
I would completely support that.
Who's that?
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
DAD!
I don't think so.
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
This plane can not land!
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
It certainly does.
Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
Which one?
That was about a year ago.
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
Where does it say that?
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
Come on!
Okay.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
You've broken its leg!
Operations building.  Far end of the street.
Possible.
You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
Oh, God.
DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
Funded by whom?
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
What?!
Birdshit?
That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --
I'm trying!
JUMP!
You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!
Stop the program!  Stop the program!
Damn!
'Bout thirty seconds.
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
Look.
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
They died together?
They smell.
Not just every six weeks.
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
Alan!
I don't know.
You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
Okay.
Why not?
Like hell it is!
And scary.
Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Thank you.
Oh, yeah - - great.
Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.
No.
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..
You have no idea.
Machines hate you?
You want to talk about this?
The kids okay?
What kind of opinions?
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
Wu?
Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
Dorkatops!
Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
That's what I said!  You're a nerd!  They don't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds!
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
That's my job.
You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
Come on.
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
This is a legitimate cinematic genre. Just like Westerns, Comedies, Film Noire, Science Fiction...
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
No. You've told me all I need to know.
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
That doesn't make sense.
And if he's not?
Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
What is it really?
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
I don't know what you could have read.
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
Success or nothing?
Yes.
I gave it to him yesterday.
He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
You're just doing your job.
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
No.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
I've heard of it happening.
They're dead now.  We can get help.
I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.
-- Listen to me --
Eight -- and seven months.
I don't know.
No, I suppose not.
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
Close only by virtue of antithesis.
When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
... A piece of paper ...
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
Lying in the gutter where they belong.
It usually is.
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.
And we're upset too.
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
Now Ann ...
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
Father ... Father!
All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London.
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
Relax ... it was fifteen years ago. I don't do it now.
Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
How about Ann? Is she going with you?
Yeah.
Coz of something I lost.
Compassion.
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
What about him? Yes.
Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
So do I.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
-- Yes.
Will you let me ask you some questions?
Mm.
Mm.
No, I'm look --
-- Tuscarora --
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
-- OK --
OK.
-- OK?
I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
Do you know where he got the dumper?
Is that what you gave him?
I don't see anything, do you?
What?
Right back at the start, right?
Trask wants to talk with you.
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
I believed her, Pete.
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
Well as a matter of --
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
It's in the report.
I wanted to give it to you first.
All right.
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
Did she talk about him to you?
I think she's trying that.
Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
Yeah.
What else do you know?
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.
Yes sir, we know he --
That's right.  You're absolutely right...It's been a long time since I made French toast.
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
You got a letter from mom.
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
Mom, I mean dad?
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
That's okay...
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
No.
Yeah?
Oh...
It's okay, son...I'm here... Just a little more to go... Don't worry, son...I'm here...
See you in the morning light...
Sure.  Lots of times.
It's my name too.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you.
Uh, huh?
I don't understand, daddy.
Where will my toys be?
Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
Sustained.
I do not, your honor, however--
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?
Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question.  Does she have a lover?
Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
No questions.
Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
Yes...
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
No.
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
I don't know...
You have?
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
Are you firing me, Jim?
Sure.
What?!?
Murray.
I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
When Joanna--  my ex-wife--when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage...Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true.  There were a lot of things I didn't understand-- a lot of things I would do different if I could.  Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change...But we can't.  Some things, once they are done, can't be undone.  Joanna says she loves Billy.  I believe she does.  So do I.  But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue.  The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy...When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right.  But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex?  I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent:
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.
No, but--
Fuck you.  He's my son.  I'm staying with him.
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
Three.  And add some basil.
No.  I don't think so.
I told her you're doing a
Uh, huh...
Maybe.  I said maybe.  What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...
Ted, I just heard...
Yes, Holiness.
Kham, Holiness.
Khambas are wild men.
Do not worry, Holiness. They fight for you. They are under your protection.
Again?
I know.
Here. We'll collect them.
I will not approve it.
I have.
We did not.
Time to study.
Yes.
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
We do not know.
Please.
I do not know, Holiness.
He warned about the future of Tibet.
I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
Where is that?
Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
I will not go.
Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
You will always!
Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
I would not know. Maybe.
The Chinese.
Ahh.
Ahh.
But, I have no experience.
No, Holiness.
We have.
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
It happens when I land.
I need to see his habitat.
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
Yup.
I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
It came from across the lake.
Bastard bit my chopper.
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
We both know what they'll do.
That's actually the easy part.
You ready on shore?
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
No.
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
Could we have intercourse?
Guess I finally got bit.
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.
I beg your pardon?
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
Night.
I heard something.
You're mushing it a little around the--
Look.
Okay.
Well...
Keep firing!
You wanna ride in my truck?
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
It's just that--
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
I guess.
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
Part of our research--
<u>Kelly</u>--
Wild guess.
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God."
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
Hot damn, Clarice.
Agent Mapp! Thank you!
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
I see.  Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy.
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
And what is that, sir?
I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice.
Murdered...? How?
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me...
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
Let's get some coffee and talk.
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
Sometimes you do.
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
How many women has he used, our Bill?
Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
Why? Do you know something about him?
Because you weren't wasting my time.
Who killed your patient?
Big through the hips. Roomy.
How long did you live there?
Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
All right, then tell me how -
Later, listen, I'll -
And - one morning I just - ran away...
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.
Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.
I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
I'm sorry.
Miss.  May I?
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
Yes. I want you to go.
"Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
What the bloody hell plan is this?
What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
We were headed...
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
Ottawa!
That is sedition! Treason!
I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall... into British hands...  What white water?
We don't.
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
That's all, sir.
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
And what is that?
By your leave, sir.
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
The decision is final.
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
Wampum?
For Munro children?
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
This interview's over! The militia stays!
Be my guest.
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
Were, Doss <u>were</u>.
Shit...
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
You screw around like that again and--
Good...It's going good.
Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.
You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
...I'd really have to show it to you.
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
And it killed Bo?
I know that.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.
You're damn right I do.  Five years down here and I'll pull in more than 15 topside.  I'm not down here for the fun, I'll tell you that.
Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
Itches like hell.
It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.
I'm going to kill it!
Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
Under there?
Two hundred meters.
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
The good doctor signed our death warrant.
Hardly.
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
Probably no longer than four weeks.
Well, it's still a good idea.
It's hit us all hard!
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
Well what?
You get the guns?
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
How about you? All right?
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
What do you mean?
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
I'11 meet you in the car.
I'll only be a minute.
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
I like your bar.
Do you want me to draw a picture?
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
Doesn't sound very good to me.
I think you're Nick the Greek.
I'll only be a minute.
At what, exactly?
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
How the fuck should I know?
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
They stole our land--
I can fix cars.
You think I can't learn that?
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
No, sir--
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
We were just dancing--
Everybody on the border knows that story.
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
You got to investigate. No question about it.
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
So they stayed in Florida?
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
He does.
You lived in the States for a while?
You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
It's a lead mine.
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
We should just do it.
That ring--
Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.
If the next guy's a redneck.
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
That's where he fell.
Why would you want to do that?
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
Protection?
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
That Buddy was a cool breeze.
Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
We don't need a new jail.
When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
And the ten thousand?
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
The Sheriff.
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
He was killed.
A little older than Paloma is now.
I never said that.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
Not if I can help it.
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
That was the night he disappeared?
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
Well, you were working there--
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
Nothing.
If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
The shooter local?
Gotta be in person.
Don't know if I'll still want it.
Payne.
I know that.
You going to tell him?
Yeah.  It's French.
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
How?
My life was too weird for her.
Knew what?
That's so cool.
I told you --
All right.  It was...
It's him... it's him.
Why did you wait so long?
Yes.
And you don't ask questions?
Does that mean...?
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
You didn't marry him for love.
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
Why don't you tell me the truth?
Hang on!
Harry-?
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
Somebody killed him.
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
So could you walk on water?
What about Swann's miracles?
Fuck you.
We've never met.
I'm here to offer you a job.
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
I don't think the dead much care.
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
A ticket home,
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
Yeah, I know.
No.
Yes.
I tried to pay you off.
We've got to get you to a hospital.
What about?
I won't say anything.
They'll never find out.
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
I did it for Dorothea.
Will that do?  No?
No.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
Yes?
I got to go.  I'm late.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
And he's dead?
I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
Ok.
No.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
OK, see you downstairs.
Yeah, you don't remember?
No, you smiled.
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
Oh, she'll love it.
Yeah.
You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
A coke.
Thanks.
Yes?
Yes?
Ok, well... I love you.
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
What are you talking about?
Alright?
Fine.
It's Lydia, your wife.
That's ok.
Bye.
Do you want I send it to your room?
One moment, please.
Hello, can I have room 5601.
What?
Why do you have to defend her?
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
I got some hair stuff.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
It'll just be a few days.
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
When did they find her?
I can't believe Will killed him.
I found the pentacle.
So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.
What time did you make it for?
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
Just open the door, please.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
Peter, please...
Please, the children.
Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
Your 33rd birthday.  The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead.  Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
We're going to do this.
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
Terrific.
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
We millionaires yet?
Thanks for having me, Sally.
How're you doin' today?
Nothing.
Need any help?
That's ridiculous.
The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
Really?  Well, come on, then.
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
Then I'll get you some punch.
Uh-huh.
Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
He's in college?
How'd you get him to say yes?
I was just playing ball.
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
Lucky.
Uh huh.
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
Oh.
My Dad always drives my Mom.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
I don't.
Yeah.
You either.
Hey.
So you took Shawnee, huh?
Figures.
I know, right?
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
You're not stupid.
It happens, right...
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Hey, what's up.
The "man" again.
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
Yup.
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
We won the championship.
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
Oh yeah?
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
Getting there.
Find.
What?
you woke me up to tell me that?
Then why are you so upset?
What?
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
Business folks.
Keep your voice down.
Nona, please.
We still have to go?
Okay.
I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
Tell me what?
I mean, it's not true, is it?
Your door was unlocked.
What?
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
Came by to check on you.
Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.
I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
These adults are tough enough, I think you'll be surprised -- the Mexican's a bit of a question mark --
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
No.  No.
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf?
You don't have a boyfriend?
Who was it?
It's fine.
I'm a bit of a slob myself.
You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
-- do you wanna cup?
-- is not my boyfriend.
yeah, good, ok.
You wanna go on a date with me?
I thought you were flirting with me a little.
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
I'm sorry.
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
What?
You don't know how crazy I am.
I've got troubles.
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
-- Richard.
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
Son, don't --
-- no.
Sorry, little man.
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
No Can Do.
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
Not yet -- "give you the clue for the bust if you show me some trust --"
Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
Braces.
Yes.
Don't do this, Don.
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
Who?
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
Hi.  Is Frank there?
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
And that's what you've heard?
My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
Well I guess it doesn't.
He passed away.
I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
What's this, how did this happen?
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
No.
Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
All your other fluzzies?
Fuck no.
I need you to get me Paula --
Are you alright?
Jean Baptiste Poquelin Moliere.
I'm drinking.
--- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
Will that help?
Yes.
Paula.  Ellen.
Is it over 'cause you're sick?
Well maybe.
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
No.
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
What are you doing?
Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
...I don't....
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
Shut up -- shut up --
-- the fuck are you talking about?
We need more dog food --
Love you too.
Sure.
See you.
Yes.
Go to bed.
Hi.
It's ok.
Yes.
It's not right.
I have money.
No, stay back!  Stay back!
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
My guards are useless!  Take her from me!
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh?
I am with you!
A body.
Tomorrow.
You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
I know.  God go with you.
You can't do it.
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.
Forgiveness?
I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
Well... Well... Okay.
Why didn't you say so?
Who?
At a ball, everyone watches the King!
Perhaps this will help.
She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
To kill the king.
No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.
I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
What is its antidote?
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
And you never knew why?
Phillippe.  Rest now.
Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
Your Majesty has had many women --
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
Yes, yes, go on.
... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
Out directing the search for the traitors.
What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
A letter.  May I see?
If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
Alright, stay on the phone.
It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
Fine...
Right behind you.
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
And who are you?
And he took a swing at you?
Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
Yeah?
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
Yeah.
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
A bank?
I'm not going anywhere!
Hop in.
Then what did you do, play canasta?
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
That's when it happened?
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
Read it.
I have to.
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
Somebody hurt him?
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
What do you want to do?
Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
In eight days.
No, thanks. I manage very well.  I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...
I have work to do at the plant.
No!
Yes.
I don't know...
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, God.
Please, no.
Not me.
No.
'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
Absolutely,
Uh... sure...
It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
Most people are.
Cut the general crap.
What's average?
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
I have to see somebody.
Blue, then.
You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us.  And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay...  He's after you now, isn't he?
You got a deal...
My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...
Go on to the house.
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
Yes.
...after a while.
No.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
That's interesting.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
Yes.
Tank you veddy much.
It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk.
"No"?  "No" to which part??
Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
Hi... am I late?
I'm here, ain't I?
If you want...
Okay.  You're probably right.
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
You're a wimp.
Then your father's a wimp.
What?!?
Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
No!  Andy, don't do it --
What is this, World War Two...?
No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
Yes, your Holiness?
Oh.
I'll take my chances!!
I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
Of course he's in his room.  All his "friends" are in there.
See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!
Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
It's already begun.
You all look the same to me.
No way.  Not possible.
I know.  It's her fault.
My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
Sorry.
Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?
What happened to them?
Any time.
Goddamnit!
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
They'll be able to track it.
He's beginning to believe.
I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
The agents --
What do you know?
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
What does that mean?
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
Of the Resistance.
Why?
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
Do it!
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
What do you mean, without him?
What?
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
I just thought... you were a guy.
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
We can't leave him!
I don't know.  It just went dead.
I have to.
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too.
I believe I can bring him back.
I'm coming with you.
It wasn't fast enough.
They're hacking his mind.
Guns.  Lots of guns.
Duck!
Tank, it's me.
He's alive.
I'll be all right.
Hurry, Neo.
Let go of her.
That means it's good.
All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...
Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you.
'And with your spirit.'
No.
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
Panther!  Same thing...
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
Don't worry.  I can handle it.
I don't like loading crates.
Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
I could have told you that.
Did you see them run!
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
Don't be smart.
What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
No.
I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
$20.
He'll be here.  Look, take this for now.
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
Fine.
That's nice.
Chinese food?
Oh...around...why?
You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
Wha?
Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
Well...
Charlie...?
What is it now?
You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
Not sick...just stupid.  Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
Sure...He lives there?
Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
Well you can't blame them in a way.
I know...I know.
You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
This is some boat.  Your father's?
Yeah, I think so.
Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
Yeah, speak for yourself.
Hi, Allison --
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
And you could care less --
Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
Yes, it is.
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
I thought you were buying my company.
Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
Yeah.  Goodnight.
Hello, Quince.
Here...
Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
Why yes, thank you.
I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
A voice?
Did you just hear something?
That's great!  Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou.
Me, too.
As close as a deal could be.
Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --
What?!
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
I thought this was practically a done deal --
Please, Drew.
If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
I don't think so.  Do you?
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
Yes.
Rass!
Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
What?
Yes?
Are you?
No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
You love Allison, don't you?
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
No.
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
Yes?
Then why are you here, Joe?
Watch me do what?
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
Not now.
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
It comforts you, doesn't it?
I am, too.
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
Yes.  I'm tired.
-- I guess you haven't.
I am.
How beautiful.
And you can't tell me who you are.
We know all that we need to know --
It's a saying.
And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
-- Yes?
Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
Good night to you, Bill.
Yes?
Make an exception?
Can you keep a secret?
No.
I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
It's all yours.
That's okay.
Just a manner of speaking.
Then I can't help you.
Yeah.
I was just asking, Bill.
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
I don't expect you to.
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
Death!
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
You should hope quite a while.
It's enough now.
Thank you, Quince.
Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
Hi, honey.
I am.  With you.
Probably.
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
What were you going to say?
So what's wrong with that?
You're not listening --
That's all?
I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
Yer damn right.
We've met.
Yeah, it's good to get together.
Raise away.
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
Where's he going?
That's why it's okay.
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
The fireworks are about to start.
So you're a one-girl guy?
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
From what?
Just loud enough to wake me up.
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
That's the thing. I have this condition.
No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably...
That must suck. All... backwards.				 *
As requested.
This isn't my room?
When was I in here?
Why?
Just two. So far.							  *
Hi, Leonard.
That's right I did, didn't I?
A cop?
* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
Thanks.
What the fuck are you doing here?
No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
Did you?
She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.
Just relax.
Who did he go to meet?
I have this condition -
Don't protect him.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
Why not?
Thank you.
Well, that's me.
Then why are you here?
I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
I enjoy it.
Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
No! Should I?
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
Why?
What's wrong with this one?
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
She's involved with these drug dealers.
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town. 
Somehow, I'll know!
To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
Quit it!							 * 					   * You're not a killer, Lenny. That's why			 * you're so good at it.						   *
Why would I have a gun?
Lemon or lime?
"And" what?
There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
Good.
Jos Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
It's a rip and a hit.
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
25% discount on the load.
Havana.
Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
That's right.
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
What do you mean?
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
Hola, viejo.
Do I need it?
When?
I'll be on board by noon.
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
What'd Neptune tell you?
Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...
Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
'Cause she will tell you.
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
Five minutes...
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
No.
On my way back...
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
Twenty on my man...
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
...so there's <u>no</u> industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight?
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
We don't know.
Have faith.
How will it stand up?
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
...and thanks for the flowers.
Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
Define small.
"Future" of...?
Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
Do we need this...?
Alonzo...
Men, they mostly faggots.
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
Yeah, oh yeah.
Sure you're all right?
No. Of course not. Just something struck me funny...
I ain't sleepy.
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
Now take it. Go on.  Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...
It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
Can he smell the difference, eh?
Don't need a comb.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
Yeah.
Who?
Shee-it. You believe all you read?
I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.
You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.
What?
No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.
Get outta my way.
Ready for anything.
Get down -- where?
Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
Is he all right!
Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
Well, it's an interesting place...  Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.
Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
...She was on the plane.
Lucky girl.
Twelve years.
Hello.
Thank you.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Section 13?
Yeah.
You know where it is?
Oh shit.
Cat, ah!  Ayip!
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
Work, work, work, that's all do
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
Yeah...?
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
All right, motherfucker, that's it.
Just do it!
Go!! Just go!!
Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
I pull.
Nino, please...
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
Don't get kinky here...
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
Try not to sweat?
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.
What is it?
Fuck! It broke the skin...
I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
It's fine.
You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
I know how that can be.
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
Great.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
C'mere, I'll show you.
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
I can't write this anymore.
The what?
What?
A toast?
What?
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
Be my guest.
You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
What? What is it?
Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
G'bye, Ms. Sindell.
If I can.
No, the typing kind.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
All done, chief..
Mmmm.
I suppose I did.
Well, that's good, isn't?
What are you talking about?
An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
In downtown Sydney for a start.
Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
In other words, you're calling her a flake.
It's that time.  Go.
Right.
And the check's in the mall.
He's heading down the stairs, now..
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
No.  Should I?
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
They've got a book for everything.
And six billion in the world.
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
Affirmative.
How do you suggest I go about it?
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
Yes.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.
Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.
'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
Hes putting on a show, Barnes.
We got it.  On your feet.
What happened to Jim?
Take off your God damn coat!
Who is "they?"
No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
Sure...
I sent the message to Max.  Were on for tomorrow.
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
Of course - Im sorry to hear you say that Claire.
My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- dont know
Yeah.  I follow you.
Who else is left?
Why was there another team?
The arms dealer.
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Information.
Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
Why don't you come back with me?
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
Bank?
My contact is extremely shy.
What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
I didn't touch it.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Very well.
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
But, he didnt know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  "Thou shall not covet thy Neighbours wife", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the worlds lovers, hes tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way I do?"
Youre wrong about one thing.  Im not the only one whos seen you alive.
Of course I can hear you.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
Twenty minutes.
This wasnt what we discussed.
Connection denied.
No, I'm going.
Very good.
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
Hello, Mr. Castorini.
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
I won't come.
That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
And what did they say?
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
You have too many dogs.
I'm going to marry him.
I'm making you a steak.
You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
Instantaneous.
Yesterday.
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
Just Johnny.
You really are stupid, you know that.
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
Take it easy.
You ruined my life.
Oh no I didn't!
What?
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
Yeah.
I think that's it.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Is Johnny here?
Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 
What!
She was too young for him.
Seven-thirty.
How about a month from today?
Pop don't like Johnny.
I got married before, you didn't sell.
Where you been?
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
She recovered.
It was a miracle.
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
Did you see it?
Oh.
The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
I came right from the airport.
You don't know where Loretta is?
It was a miracle!
It's nothing!
None of your business.
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
Yes.
My God, it's a mansion!
What? What?
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
Oh. Right.
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
What do you mean?
Not at all.  They could be carried.
Please!
I am your king!
And not too expensive.
Now - go!
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
Oh, please!
I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
No, no ... not "is"!
Had enough?
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
That's it.  Ni!  Ni!
What does it say?
It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!
I am an enchanter.
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
What?
I warned you!
Man!
Well ... I AM king.
... Well, we did do the nose.
I'm not dead!
I'm getting better!
I can't take him.
When's your next round?
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
I'm not quite dead, sir ...
Farewell, Concorde!
Camelot?  Are you from Camelot?
But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
Listen, Alice ...
Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
I was saved at the last minute.
Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
No.  It's unhealthy.
Please ... we are doctors.
You've come to rescue me?
He's come to rescue me, father.
A path!  A little path for the late Knights of Ni!
Brave, Sir Rob ...
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
How about yourself?
There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
But I'm the only one she trusts.
I can't let her down now, Archie.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
I can't move to tidy.
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
She's busy.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
Out of my way!
It's so infernally cold in here.
We --
I beg your pardon?
Is that the Queen's request?
I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard.  In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --
Occasionally.
I don't think about it.
It's nothing.
Why do you think I keep her here?
The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
She trusts you, John.
They aren't as watchful as you.
No love.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
Aye, ma'am.
What?
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
Are they worth reading?
What does he know about the Highlands?
Yes, ma'am?
I do not accept.
The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
Have I ever let you down before--?
I'm breaking no promises!
No, ma'am.
Yes.
Who?
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
Excellent!
Whom?
Why am I being lectured in this way?!
What is he doing there?
I understand he was in a fight.
A few days, ma'am.
I have no idea.
From whom?
Yes, ma'am.
He is sick, ma'am.
Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
He?
It's the game, ARCADE.
There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
What the hell does that mean?
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
You imagined it.
What?
Dante's Inferno.
Put in a quarter.
We're actually inside, aren't we?
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
Got it.
Yeah, that's what worries me.
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
Yes...
Then we'll go home.
You have no time.  What is your question?
I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...
Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.
Who fired everyone?
No.
I'm going home Cynthia.
I'm going home. I'll call you later.
You're broke!
I'll speak to someone.
Howdy to you.
Whatever.
I agree with what you said...truly.
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
Well, I ...
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
But it said #12.
I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
Oh...
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
"You know what I want...it's not that difficult."
I'm all right.
But I want to.
And who are we auditioning for today?
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
This Denny's.
Oh boy.
Could be unrelated.
Interesting.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
We have to climb up that.
I'm working on it.
It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
I'm not listening.
Not listening !
I'm listening.
So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
Okay.
Fine...
Let's go.
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
I don't help criminals.
Because of my charming personality ?
A dragon.
Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
That's cute asshole.
What the fuck are you talking about.
Ow...
You've got it boss. One more mangled body to the East River, coming up !
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat.
I just want to double check the facts.
Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
What do you mean sir ?
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
What did you hear ?
I was.
Then what do you want ?
I'll see that bet.
Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
What happened ?
How can this happen ?
As appealing as that sounds...
No ! Just get up. This is serious.
Which one, this door is locked !
"How's your foot" ? This guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place, and you want to know how his foot is ?
Shut up ! It's me.
I was thinking maybe we should try this dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot version will be open by then....
Who was that guy anyway ?
Good morning.
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick
Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine.
It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?
Thanks, I needed that.
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
She just had a baby that's all.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
No.
I was pushing as fast as I could.
Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.
You mean, you knew about me?
Does she?

Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
More than anything in the world.
Well...
oh.
Come on in!
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
But I wanna write about her.
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
Hi.
Ehh...I'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best Jag people in town...so uhm.
It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
You're so clever.
Yeah, RIGHT.
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
May I use the phone please.
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
DON'T, come on!!!
In the tar??
Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Sounds like you're very organized.
Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.
Bye Niece, Vada.
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
You couldn't?
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
I bet your mom sang to you.
Oh no.
Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
But Dad'll never go for it.
Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
He is?
This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...
Good for you baby.
No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
Deceased.
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
Oh that, she just likes to play.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
I wrote that.
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
No. Just, more activity.
Why d'you think these seats were empty.
It's nice.
Are you mad at me?
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
In ages, I know, me neither.
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.
Want to what?
Goodnight.
Really?
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
Is it really your camper?
Pointing upwards Look...
I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
Dad?
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
Any more soda left?
Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
Sorry.
No, sweetie, not yet.
Hi.
Feeding my fish.
Get away, get away!!
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
I'm very nervous.
Hi, is Vada home?
For this class?
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
I wrote a poem too.
Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
I am.
Chocolate?
Can we look around in your camper?
Uh huh.
No, I'm divorced.
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
A girl's always gotta look her best.
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Uh huh, why?
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
Goodnight.
Liverpool?
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
Hey, where does it say that?
It's my mother.
HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
What?
So?
My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
But I have my clothes on!
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
I wanna live with them too.
Really?
Leave then, some friend you are.
Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
Okay, okay.
I should look different.
I honestly wish I could...
If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
No, he's ruining yours.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
You like her.
You've been working on this, huh?
Someday she'll thank you.
It's too late to start over.
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
To belong to someone.
Good girl.
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
A trademark move, don't touch it.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...
Gold nose hair clippers.
I just don't want to freak him out.
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
... unless he has a hump.
Nobody has.  So far.
Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...
Well, somet...
Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.
Firenze.
Till the gas ran out.
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
You keep saying that.
If you like.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
A bad combination.
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
... yeah, that.
Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
Shhh.
This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.
Lower.
That is so romantic.
If you find her...
... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
Like family, huh?
To him.
Well, if that's the way you f...
You're much more his type.
You got a real good memory, Star.
What do you have to buy?
Hi! Star.
Is there food?
Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.
How did you come in here?
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
Oh, sure.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
Who the hell is he?
Third party?
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
Whose?
Sure thing.
Sue was trying to get hold of you.
National?
I'll just be in here.
I think we can do that. Come in.
She sure sings nice.
It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
I don't really know what you're talking about.
No.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
Oh... Well.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
About three years.
Linnea?
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.
End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
Oh.
I'm not sure...
What?
Yea.
I'm sorry but I have to go.
How much?
Sleeping.
Out.
Do you study at all?
Just a minute.
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
Who?
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
You bet.
You think I should take lessons?
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style.
That's what Tim said.
Yes, I would.
Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
Thank you, sir.
You been followin' the news coverage?
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
How's it goin'?
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
She was born without a tongue.
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
How 'bout Manson?
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
Do you miss Mallory?
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
Okay, let's cut it.
Got it.
Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.
We are.  Your camera.
No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
You made every day like kindergarten.
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
Capt'n!
Thanks.
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
Yeah, sure.
When do you want the assembly?
Okay.
Slate it.
Why?
But you'll never be whole again.
That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.
Really?
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
Don't call my men assholes.
See Duff. He's the money man.
You in a big hurry, boy?
That's right.
Well, what d'you know?!
Where was that?
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
'That right? I thought he was up North.
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
Like hell they wouldn't.
Okay.
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
No.
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
Why did you?
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
Well, what d'you think?
You still didn't answer my question.
Uh-huh. Why?
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
Yeah!
What the hell could you do?
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
Watch out!
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
You don' know nothin' 'bout it, baby. Nothin'! And don't kid yourself - you did your bit.
Duff--
Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
'Bye, Jocko.
Who're you?
Great.
No, thanks.
Okay.
She don't look no worse to me.
I said, she's in great shape.
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
Okay.
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
'Musta knocked her up.
I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
I know.
That'll make the folks very happy.
Okay, boy, beat it.
Right here.
Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
No. I only needed the code from you.
She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
Why not?
I'd say you were full of shit.
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
The words?
Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
You're pleasant tonight.
Yeah.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
Right...
How are we doing?
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
And Linda...
What's my end?
Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
Almost two days.
We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
A regular Fagan.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
I'll be okay.
What went down between you and Riviera?
No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
...And if I guess wrong?
Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
Shut up.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
Yes, it's lame.
Exactly.
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
YOU KNIT?
Leave.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
What about the "Roaring Twenties" or "The 80's"?
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
That is lingerie.
That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
Why?
It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
A flack jacket.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
Are you in special ed?
I'm Rob's prom date.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Is that true?
Better than I...
Sorry. Forgetful.
Thank you.
Don't look down!
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
Thanks. So do you.
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
Wait, I was going to tell you--
What?
We're very evolved.
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Lock.
And heavy...
For this.
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
I know.
Just what?
Good.  I'm hungry.
No.
<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
Maybe he doesn't know...
Just out for a while.
Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
I wasn't sure, Ken...
Oh, please...
Where's Jesse?
What about it?
What the hell are you talking about?
My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
Wow...
Something Grady told me today about the people that lived here last. Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed in the house across the street...
Research.  Hi.  C'mon, let's go for a ride.
I don't know.  Where are we going?
I'll get over it.
I don't know - a sharp pain.
I'm not hungry.
What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me...
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
Hi.
Hi, Kerry.
All of them.
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
They're healing up nicely.
Watching TV.
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
He's real.
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
Yeah, but I was really not good.
You did it the other night.
I don't know.
They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
Fuck off.
She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
Thank you.
That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
You know what he did.  He's doing it again.
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
Didn't get much sleep.
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
Breathe deeply and relax...starting with your toes, relax everything until there's no tension left in your bodies.  None at all.  Keep following the pendulum...
Everybody take five.
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
Your dreams?
Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
What about Kristen?
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
No.  We're alone.
A sad choice.
Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
Uh, fourteen.
I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
Me too.
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
I'm delighted.
Night, night, Honey.
I'm not listening.
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
No.
Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
Okay.
You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
I thought you were leaving.
Step aside.
She saw through me.
No, you were brilliant
Come in.
This is the place.
Oh no no -- no.
Well, get a message through to him too.
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
What?
You and every person in this country.
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
Stay forever.
How do you think I'm doing?
That's spectacularly unfair.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
Okay.
Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
Nice surprise.
Miracles do happen.
Anna Scott?
Right. 
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
Tony -- what do you think?
What?
It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
No -- it's my 22nd.
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
What's your name?
Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check.
This is Henry James film?
Ah... yes, enormously.
Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
Definitely no comment.
She's perfect, perfect.
Is it someone we know?
So not over her, in fact.
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
How about Miss Flintstone?
Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
No, no.  She doesn't.
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Point taken.
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Absolutely not.
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
No, 'fraid not.
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Why not?
I'm sorry.  Which hospital?
What book?
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
I-I-I...
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Sorry, ma'am.
No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes.
I wanna report a robbery!
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
A vote is before the group.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
No, it was irresponsible!
Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
Please see to Mister Bromden.
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
W-W-Where we g-g-going?
C-C-C-C-Candy!
Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!
Ca-na-da...
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
What for?
They went that way.
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
Huh?
Me, too...
She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
What for?
Now, what would I be trying to say?
You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
What for?
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
No!
No!
What's he talkin' about?
Can you borrow me a dime?
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
Yeah, Mac?
No.
Hold it!
McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
I see.
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
Oh, yeah?
How much ya wanna bet?
I don't believe it...
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
To help you relax... please...
He's in charge.
Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
After you, ma'am.
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
Huh?
Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...
Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am...  A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...
Is he one of the loonies?
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck.  Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck.
Oh, yeah...
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
--separate, in the evening..."
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.
Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
But Faith--
Hm.
My name's 
You said whatever it was you would understand.
Who says I don't love him?...
Tell me.
Mickey Spillane?
Well, good.  Good for you.
Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
Yeah.
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
No.  Course not.
I know the feeling.
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
What?
I can't believe you did that!
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
I brought you that, too.
Just since yesterday.
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
So?...
I don't know, Kate.
Yes you did.
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
No...  I can just tell.
You don't have a passport.
Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 
Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
What?
Are you sure?
Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
He fell out.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
Like a detective.
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
I know, but...
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
What?
I'll be back before you leave.
Yup.
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.
I'd love to.
I thank you.
No.
He missed me.
Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
Good strategy.
Mania.
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, "Nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say  Talk with your mouth wide open," so if I'm loud don't blame me it's the fault of the nuns!
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out we take our cut.
Why should he forget it?
I'm not thirsty.
This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
He probably gave 'em an argument.
Yeah yeah I guess I do but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
I don't know I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Don't say that!
Don't say that!
I could have been better!
Okay I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
Hello, Edie.
Terry... Terry... .
You hear that, Terry?  Terry, did you hear that?  You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk.
Everybody knew him. He got around.
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were
Do you like pigeons?
Good. So do I.
The things that go on.
Oh she's a beauty.
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
Get away from me.
I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
You always said I was a bum. Well  not anymore. I'm going down to the dock. Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot anybody. I'm just going to get my rights.  Joey's jacket. It's time I start wearing it.
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
Who is he, Pop?
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
Good luck.
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom with the truth as you know it  Truth is the gun Drop that thing and tell the truth a more dangerous weapon than this little   cap pistol.
I can? Okay.  Okay...
Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
Down to the wire?
You know what you're askin'? You're askin'
Well, it'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it. Don't you think?
You want to know something I would have taken Wilson
Sure... .
Be sure they got enough water.
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
Hit me again.
First things first.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
By way of Chicago?
Aw, Johnny... .
Nothing happened, Johnny.
Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
Then..then what's that music?
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
I'm afraid I'll faint.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
What can we do against them?
The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
You mean...!
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
You need not worry...Not just now, anyway.
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
I know a Glenn.
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been.  He tell you how they met?
Till they got busted.
Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.
Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.
The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
You're right.
Am I going to Detroit by myself?
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
He knows where she lives?
I'm a tourist.
Now you're talkin'.
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
Whatta you wanna do?
I get that feeling, yeah.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
All you gotta do is get in.
Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
It was an unusual experience.
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel.
They're in 7D.
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
Wait.  You not Adele?
I could walk out of here.
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Why you think is today?
Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
Wait, I know him --okay?
Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
I thought everything.
Not until recently.
If I could have a little more room.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
Uh-huh.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
Faye Dunaway.
Peter Finch.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
You won't do that.
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
I just thought maybe you and me could--
I can go to the bar.
Those guys bother you?
Love it.
It's not a game.  Something you play.
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
So do you.
She did, huh.
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare me.
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?
I don't know...
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
How many?
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
Jesus, I don't believe it.
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
I'm freezing my ass off.
Really?
Uh-huh.
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
Great.  We got one of 'em.
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
Huh.
No?
Off a tip?
So?
Yeah, as soon as we got back.
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Are they dead?
No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."  I've never known it to fail.
Red...Strange?
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
You guys know her?!  I gotta have an intro!  Man, I'd like to --
A m-missionary?
They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
Well...sure.
The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off the carriers from there.
You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?
I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.
Our doctor's gone too.
Yes'm.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
Respect.
We're all going away.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
How did you?...
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
Brilliant, Admiral.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
Have the planes made it to China?
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
Learn English, then!
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
Charlie! Am I dead?
They'll learn to live with it.
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
Let's go down to the basement.
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
How'd you know about that?
Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
Right here. Now sit down.
What?
You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
Of course.
I've got to go now.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
I'll never give up.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
I'd love to.
I can't do that.
Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
Can we split now?
What?
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
Doing some shopping?
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
How do you feel?
Oh. I forgot.
I had a dream that Grandma died.
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
For what?
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
You're a sweet man, Richard.
How, did you know about my grandfather?
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
Give me some credit, will you?
When do we start?
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
Well... uh... thanks...
I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
I'll be fine, Dad.
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
I'm not hungry.
I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
I'm not burying him here...
What did?
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
You never get over it.
Maybe it takes a while...
All the time.
You know everything, don't you?
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
Sorry...
K-R-O-one.
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
One hour!
I promise!
I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
Close the law book.
Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!
Of course.
Honesty is always best.
Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
It's okay. Can I sit down?
One week old.
Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
We?
Not bad.
Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on Monday.
Charles. Okay. Miller?
Do you... pray?
What have you prayed for?
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
Want to hear my favorite aria?
You're ready, don't worry.
Something like that.
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
Yes.
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
I'm not worried. What are you doing?
Right.
Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.
Get a life.
Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
Any women on board?
Yes, we did.
Helloooo...
Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
Look deeper.
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
Entered our minds.
Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
<u>Listen</u>.
What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
Get out of our way.
One or two.
Let's drop back an' boot up.
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
I can't....I can't....
But they...they could still be....
Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
Possibly.
Big Evil?
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
Only around humans.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
I assume he licked it clean.
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
60 years ago.
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
You coulda helped. And you didn't.
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
What the hell's it matter?
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
We're all on the same hajj now.
There is no "safe."
He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
Like an emergency life-raft, right?
Oh, so I'm disposable?
Looks clear.
Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
About the girl.
They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
What, it's broken?
Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets.	Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
Do you have any weapons?
Just the same, I want one.
No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
Good luck then.
Remembers what?
Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Zira....
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
Yo!
Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
Let's find them all.
Blessed are the vegetarians.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
Sustained.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
Climb off me, will you!
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
What?
The Hunt Club.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
I don't know.
He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
A hearing.
Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Maybe not.
You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.
He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
Taylor, you can't.
We can't.
God bless you.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
Like you, I find it difficult.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
I'll get him. You get the man in, Taylor  NOW. Or I'll Article 15 both your asses. Move!
Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.
Yeah, what is it?
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
Shaddup bitch.
Barnes comes from Hell.
I got one...
Over here!
Okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.
No!
...don't feel like it either.
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
No... I move faster alone. 
Yeah, I dropped out of college and told 'em I wanted infantry, combat, and Nam...
...there's nobody.
So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here.
I remember first time you came in here Taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard.
If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
That's what he is... Baaaa!
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
How do you do?
Maybe you're going to have to like me.
Just drunk enough.
How long would that take?
Immigration Officer?
I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
I see.
Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
I don't.
Quarter after one. Why?
I'm different. I like it fine.
Is this the best you can do?
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
Couldn't be.
All right--following me.
So have I.
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
Wonder what?
That's right.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please.  You big, open-handed, generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?
Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
Beer?  Well, all right.
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
It is?
Who told you I was married?
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
Sometimes.
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
All right. Get him.
Who's Goble?
This way.
I'm not interested in blind dates.
Yes, I've seen it before.
I don't.
I never notice the view after the first week.
A couple of hours.
That must hurt.
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
Did I do something wrong?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Mr. Mitchell.
I don't think you locked your door.
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
Let me know when you've identified him
I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
Go live in a tent.
So it seems Sergeant.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
I've always looked forward to it. All right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
Such as?
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.
Warm water, no doubt.
It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
How do you do, sir.
Aye.  You have a point there.
When I give an order, you'll not need it interpreted.  You have an hour to make your mind up.  Well, are ye satisfied, Mr. Mitchell?
She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
What does it look like?
How about your new friend?
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
It's kind of you to see me.
Yes.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
Of course.
Thank you.
Freshman and sophomores...
And to history.
That's her.
Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway.
Who?
Very thoughtful.
No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
I might.
That'll be fun
I know.  I'm sorry.
We were just chortling over that. Blas and epicene.  It perfectly describes the new Foreign Secretary. So--I hope you don't mind, Edward, I pinched it for my piece today.
No jokes.  James is in love.
Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
You're so gross.
You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
I'm off.  Let's meet.  You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
Are you up to something?
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
Hello.
She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
Have you come to talk about me?
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
You'd look naked without one.
Not yet.
No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
You first!
Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
The shit they pull, huh?
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
The fucking punks are surfers.
Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
Thanks, buddy.
Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
This Zen master surfer.
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
Shrimp and fries.
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
Sure.
He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
What?
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
No way, old buddy.
Who's our back-up on this?
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
Anytime.
Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
I'll take him.
Philip!  We'll need shoes!
Twenty-five percent.
You're not getting any navy contracts.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
You're making the right decision, sir.
Yes.
Yes.
You're not from L.A., huh?
What motel you staying at?
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
What?
You mean they don't have hookers.
Diet coke.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
Why?
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Just a romantic, that's you.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
I have work to do.
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Good.
Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
Ready to stomp sod?
Vivian...
Where are you taking me!?
I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
Did you?
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
My what?
Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
No.
Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
We're letting them slide?
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
I'm up.
Why?
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart.
Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
Rent.  You're late.
Okay.
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
But I always eat like this.
I like steak.
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.
Yeah.  Thanks.
You survived the Fire Swamp. You must be very brave...  ... but nobody withstands The Machine. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
I swear it will be done.
They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
Of course you will.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
Gently.
It never happened.
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
But you don't know where he is.
How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
Over the Albino, I think.
What is it?
Because I can stop now if you want.
Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
Okay.
As you wish...
Sire.
My spy network has heard no such news.
It won't be easy, Sire.
The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
DEATH FIRST!!
I swear it will be done.
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
Not yet.
I thought he was with you.
In that case --
Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
That does put a damper on our relationship.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
Tell me.
Get used to disappointment.
I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
Inconceivable!
Morons.
I smell nothing.
Hmm.
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
I'm not listening.
Nobody's hearing nothing!
A good hour. Yeah.
A little bit.
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
Congratulations.
"I want to croon,
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady. 
Then account for yourself!  Do you believe in God?  Do you believe in gold?  Why are you looking up old lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert, eh?
Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
No way out.  No way out.
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
Got dag pa dig.
Nice girl.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Wagner...
The Graf Spee...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
Anyone at home?
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
Who are you, friend?
Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
Teddy called.  Me... And my mother called to see if Teddy called. Oh, and your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
A lot?
What difference does that...
Lila.
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
No.
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
She'll need both of us.
First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
Yes.
Sam.
Without calling me?
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
Well?
Does that mean we can't...
All right! Then call! At least, call!
She always tries to be proper.
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
Sam. This is the last time.
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
Can you?
You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
I have to go, Sam.
Sam! No!
I'll lick the stamps.
Don't miss your plane.
Los Angeles.
Uncommon, too.
It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
I mean... ill.  She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when.  Well... It was just too much for her when he died, too... And the way he died... Oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating.  Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left.
I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
Good night.
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
Why?
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
Fine.
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
Leave me alone!
From what?
Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
I don't know--I can't tell--
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
Maybe you're right.
Why didn't you notify the police?
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!
A voice ...
Yes.
But ... the dogs...
No?
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
I'll have it for supper.  So long.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
I'm not quarreling, only ...
I'd love to, at any time.
Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
What do you think I am?
Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
Almost certain.
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
Horsefeathers!
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
You're insane.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
Dad...
I could go out of town.
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
Well, some fiend might.
There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
Yeah, he's still up there.
No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
What did you say, Brother?
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
Oh, shut up, Buddy.
No.
She's watching the car again?
At least.
What are they doing, Doll?
Doll, don't ask childish questions.
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
Oh, it's definitely better, beyond question. A fatherless child, an ignorant girl with no job, no money, no home. It's fortunate, a blessing really, and a stroke of good luck for another reason I want to mention to you.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
She will succeed.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
I don't see how you can even think of it now.
Um-hmm.  Come with me, Brother. I want to show you something.
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
Fine.
Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him.
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
No, sir.
Got yourself up?
My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
Yes, sir.
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
Yes, sir.
Tennessee?
Well, I'll pay you that back sometime, Mr. Hillyer.
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
That's correct -- outside it, not in it. As for the job, well, the Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ain't worth a sorry-ass damn.  But I can build anything, Buddy. Give me the plans and I can build a goddamn staircase to the moon. It's a fact, I can build anything...  ... but she never believed that. Oh, hell, no, she never believed in me.
Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
She looks terrible, just awful.
Illusions, Madam?
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
You're not gonna see him again.
Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with.  So, how's he gonna feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?
... okay... you made your point.
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
I don't know.  Fuck off!
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
Relax.
You big, fat sonofabitch, if it weren't for me, you'd still be sitting in the file room where I found you.  And you... Nena... you've still got needle scars from where I pulled you out of.  You of all people...
Could be worse.  I don't know how, but I'm sure it could.
We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.
You don't smoke.
Wha... ?
What... what kinda thing is that to say?
I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
No.
What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
We've got the tape to prove it.
There'll be other chances.
Where have you been?
Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.
What are you, communist?  At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
Absolutely.
You think this is so easy?
Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.
All for one...
Gimmie a minute.
Sounds good.
A.D. is a C.P.A.
Know what I love about dynamite?
When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
Well, that's what I heard, and that's what I choose to believe.
Yeah.
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
I can't kill my own father.
Yoda spoke of another.
But I have no sister.
Leia! Leia's my sister.
I can't see.
Where am I?
Luke!
Fine. Together again, huh?
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Leia!
He wasn't. I can feel it.
Lower it!
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
Come on! Come on!
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
Red Leader standing by.
Your Royal Highness.
Quiet.
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
I told you, my car broke down.
Rocky!
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
I've got something to say.
Dammit, Janet.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
No, don't do that.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
I didn't make him for you
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
Makes you cry
Makes you cry
You're too kind.
...I'm sorry.
...I don't know.
...Goodnight, Rocky.
To you, to me it's Thursday.
Ohh!
...I suppose.
It's not that --
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
Don't tease me.
Yes.
Yeah...
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
Paul.
Paulie!
Don't talk like that to him!
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!
People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
...Thanks.
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
Fouls.
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
No wine.
Why?
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
What's happenin' here?
Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
No action.
Black market?
Where else am I gonna go.  Bet three grand on Rocky.
Sparrin'?
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
Hey --
...Yeah.
I won't.
'Night, Marie.
I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?
...Tomato?
Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
Yeah, sure.
When was they here?
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
How do you mean?
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
Ya got heart.
Yo, Benny.
Real good.
Damn! How's it look?
...The guy's great.
Would you keep goin'?
Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there.
Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
Bullmastiff.
...Adrian ain't sharp.
...Sure.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Maybe ya better forget it.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
...Tight.
Whatta you think?
What?
What break? Huh? What break! Who am I to give breaks! I'm a fighter, you haul meat. You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life, man!
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Ask her...
You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.
It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
Why didn't you tell me?
Eddie, come on.
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
I've already seen your photographs.
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
Take it easy.
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
Me.
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
Safe?
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
Uh? Uh?
Leave Me!
Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Romeo will answer it?
The what?
By my head here come the Capulets.
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
But new struck cuz.
No, cuz, I rather weep.
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.
But 'tis no wit to go.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
Young Romeo is it?
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
Welcome.
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Ahhh!
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Well, what was yours?
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
What?
Leaving...
Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
Which leads us to...
I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
You lose them!
Not yet...
Nobody's saying they don't.
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
You sure about this?
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
There's a problem...
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
You first, Edvard.
Not so fast.  Who's that?
He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
You'll die if you leave here.
I don't have it with me...
I swear...
What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
That's it.
How did you know?
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
I didn't expect that he would.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
Not for long.
Is that right?
I blast the lead car into oblivion...
I know cops -- and you're no cop.
No thanks.
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
I do.
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
I just wanted to see something.
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
You were smoking?
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
But you can't.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
Yes.
Dark ops?
Very ugly.
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
You think?
Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it?
Do you have a good answer?
You better get some sleep, alright?
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
You slept with the fucker!!
The Russian would be easier.
I can't get enough of it.
Seven thousand...
Cash and what?
I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
What do you mean what are we going to do?
Hell, it won't be us!
Why?
At the expense of six people.
What's that?
Well, we won't do any of that shit!
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
I...I can't do that.
It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
Then we're screwed.
He killed her...he killed her...
He killed her...
Two thousand...
What are you proposing?
Just take it in stride.
No.  Why?
Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three.
I'm in here.
You deserve it is the occasion.
Nothing happened?
He's not, he's...
And I'd take it out on him.
I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
You know I do.
What did he buy?
We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
Hi.
Anything...specific?
Hmmm...
Uh...C?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Take it or leave it.
Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
What?
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
Calm down --
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
Right behind you.
I was on a roll!  Im a little overextended now.
We're gonna talk.
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
You've done without it long enough, ma.
Absolutely positively.
Anything in it?
So someone did get away.
Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
I'd like to see you try.
This is your ship?
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
That's right.
No.  It's my first time.
I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
No.
No.
I knew you were lying.
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
What?
Why LA?
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
It's your turn!
There's people up here!
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
She never even looked at you.
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
Fine by me.
Mind your own business.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
End of the line.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
What?!?!
Carter...
She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
Amen to that, brother.
What "revenge" is he talking about?
Fine with me.
Any leads?
It's my responsibility.
The Secret Service?  Why?
Are you okay, Lee?
Don't.
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
Sir, I can explain.
They asked for the best street man I had.
Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
What plate?
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
Who does not know War?  War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.
Yee-aww.
Good God, ya'll!
Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
Oh yes.
Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
It's called a dress.
That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
At this point we don't have much.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Don't play bullshit games with me.
And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
Shut up!
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
What are you talking about?
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
Han?
As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
I'm just bragging about how great you are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
"Make the shot."
"Never say die."
His hair... any color.
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
I don't know.
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Tootaloo.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
He is not!
You can turn that finger around.
Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
Really.
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Cindy the manicurist.
You afraid to try?
Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
Of what?
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
It's something I've always wanted to do.
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
Why?
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Lighten up, what?
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
Quick.  Very quick.
I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
No.
That's good.
They're going to love you.
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
Go for a walk in Central Park --
What is it?
That doesn't make any sense.
Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
I think that's what I'm saying.
There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
"I want to meet you..."
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
I know.
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
I know.
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Howard.
Any time.
Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
What?
What?
Mom!
Like... clockwork.
It's a sign.
Sure you do --
Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
It's not that late in Seattle.
She died.
I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.
You want me to talk to him?
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
What is it?
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
I don't know.  Do I?
What is it?
I don't think I have to now.
It's a spice rack.
It plays in 50 states.
Oh, you're changing your mind --
Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
Stressed.
You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
Go to sleep.
What was?
I don't know.
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Oh, right.
She's going to cook something for us?
It's only ten o'clock.
I thought I saw a black widow spider.
I was thirsty.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
No.
I just called for a second.
Victoria? She's okay.
Are you going with her?
Get out.
No.
Sure.
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
What about it?
Well...
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
I say we gotta take action. Now.
It never ends.
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
No, Estellita.
It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
Antonio paid for it.
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
Yes.
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"
She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!
I was talking to my wife.
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 
How about in the house?
Did you see his hair color?
Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
Now that's down-right insulting.
I'll see you tonight.
I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
And you admire that?
You really need to lighten up.
It's me.
Find a new job.
I can't tell you.
I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
Danny, it's not what you think.
Why's that?
You don't say.
You on a roll?
Sorry.
You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here.  Have a beer.
Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
When? When did you ever see me use?
Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
Good for you Jimmy.
If you say so.
Hey, I don't play that.
What?!
Okay! Okay!
Yeah.
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
I'll keep that in mind.
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
You go, boy.
Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
After that ass-whipping you gave me?
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...  You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ...
Answer the fucking question!
Who the hell is Jimmy?
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
They have. But they never found a lab.
I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
Again, I thank you.
Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
Don't we always take good care of you?
Maybe he isn't showing.
What is it, drugs?
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
The Army gave you that?
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
I guess.
Nope, he ain't Wade.
What deal?
To each, his own.
White-walls?
FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
I heard.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
Plenty.
Same place we are.
I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
I changed my mind.
Simpson.
What about Talbot?
Nope.
Three for three.
You're kidding yourself.
You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
How about you shut up and take your position?
About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
And what about your own hand?
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
Out of the mouth of babes.
Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
But, sir...
There's always a bright side.
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
That's a mystery to me.
What if our guys open up, sir?
You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
Struggling with a pair of Germans.
Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside.
And your former wife.
That's right.
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
Yeah.
What's a scam?
See you tomorrow.
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
Come on, it's graduation.
I'm sorry.  It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt.
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
I love you dad.
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Dad.
I'm fine.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
You're going.
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
But I found the money.
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
I'm so ashamed dad.
Hi.
Look at those eyes.
Yeah?
No, I read it on the message.
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
Goodbye.
Would you hold this for me?
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
No.
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
That's cool then.
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
Okay, bye, I will.
Wait, wait.  You told her about me?
I just can't have any social life right now.
Be friends?
Friends with potential.
I'm doing alright.
This is so noble.
Yes.  Are you shaking?
Then why are you shaking?
Your letter came yesterday.
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
What's wrong?
You need to study?
No, I don't, I don't.
No I didn't.
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
I love you.
Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
I know.
You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
No.
Yeah.  Honey?
Are you?
Very talented.
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I love you too.
Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
They're not gone, they're here.
True.
What's going on?
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
Look it up.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
We're losing the war, aren't we.
No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
Christmas presents.
I think it's too late.
No, no, what, what is it?
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  What is this?  I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
On national television.
I'm inquisitive.
I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
Home--where he lives.
Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
Finish what my son started.
Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
Let us decide that.
It's under control.
But nobody wants to see that. Itll never go. Theyll rewrite you. You dont want that.
I got it..
Until now.
The way I see it. Well be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
Or it found us.
I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
I think you're all an act.
Not good.
What are we looking for?
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
No, wait here.
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
Yeah, right.
Dewey, there's no such place.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
Watch your back.
But who would operate your camera?
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
Hello?  Hello?
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
Easy black boy.
You're not allowed to ask that.
But she's standing right next to you.
Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
We got free tickets.
Shush.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
Where you going?
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
Hello.
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
Thanks.
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
There's more.
Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
To me Hollywood is about death.
What did you know about your mother?
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
No.
Sid I can see you!
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
But you know who she was.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
What the hell are you doing?
There a story in that building?
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
Who?
I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
I'm hanging up right now.
Roman that's not the line.
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
Who is this?
How do I know their voices are --
I'll call you, when you're on your way.
It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
I'm sorry, your voice.
That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
Yes, sir.
You sleep in THAT?
What are you doing here?
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
It's been a year since she died.
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
Fuck you.
Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
Do I?
Do you like scary movies?
I believe you...
Guess.
Turn off the light.
Come on, yes you do.
Please go away! Leave us alone!
What?
Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
We haven't ruled out that possibil...
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
I'll get my camera.
And my Dad? Any word on him?
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
Yes, sir, sheriff.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
Forget it.
Has his story changed?
Why would she lie about it?
And why is that?
Uh-huh.
Twice.
She's the Scream Queen.
Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.
I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
I can cry on cue.
Like you had one.
Wanna another beer?
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Are you serious?
What happened?
No way.
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
How do you gut someone?
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
He was there, Tatum.
It's alright. I'll get it.
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
Come on, let's rock.
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
Tits -- see.
Give it to me.
Announcing what?
So what?  This victim...
Yeah.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
Who tied her down?  You or him?
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
David... please...
You'll see.
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
Murderers like you?
I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
Please be quiet for a while, would you?
No.
Tonight.
What about sports?
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
Nothing.
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
And you don't?
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
Satisfy our curiosity?
This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face.
We're focusing.
That is.
Saint Thomas Aquinas.  He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
We'll take a look at him.  Talk to him.
I'm fine.
These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.
No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
When do we get to question him?
I can tell you this.  I recognize his lawyer.  His name's Mark Swarr.
Wait!
I don't know why... why now?
I don't see anything.
What?  Oh, yes.  I mean, thank you.  Please, sit down.
Too long.  What do you think so far?
Did the wife confess?
Crime of passion.
How should I know?
They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
Don't argue!...And stay close... Maybe they're rustlers...and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong...
Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.
Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
Yes sir...
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do...
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
Cut it out, will ya...
Look?
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
What's goin' on?
It's what I'm countin' on.
They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
That's the breed...Course it might take time.
No...not yet...
A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
Finish your breakfast...
Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
Come on, say it.  You know...
You'll never get away from me!
Do you have a better idea?
You?
My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!
Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
What? What am I supposed to sense?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
Hi, darling.
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but...
How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
Tenth floor.
I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.
The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
The title won't do.
Right you are, governor!
Lady?
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
When I have fifty pounds.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
yet cannot love nor write it.
That's me.
And his ears.
Of course not!
Oh, that.
Very well.
Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
Nobody knew!
I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor.  I am sorry, Will.
It is all locked safe in here
She is always Aphrodite.
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
To my weekly confession.
To the Palace at Whitehall.
What? Who?
The one who came with your letter?
God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
No, it will turn out well.
How goes it, Will?
Good title.
The daughter of his enemy.
Mercutiogood name.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
A different one you haven't written?
Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.
I am not so well-born.
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
Stand up straight, girl.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty
Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.
"Go ask his name--If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed."
"Madam!"
Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam?
"Ay me."
I like her.
But the plague
Oh. What is your name?
I have to get back.
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
Well perhaps better than my first. 
Mr. Henslowe?
Yes, some of it is speakable.
Oh, but it will end well for love?
Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.
You never spoke so well of him.
But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
How does it?
It is not my riding day, my lord.
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
Does she say so?
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
Are you bringing your laundry woman?
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
A man, my lord?
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
Just serve.
Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
Have you seen him?
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
You're sure? There's lots more.
Not eating like you used to, that's what.
Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
Where do you think you'll go?
Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Well, yes.
OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
For the flat.
What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
So I gathered.
David?
So what's wrong with that?
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
Don't look?
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
Who?
No, I don't.
Then let's spend some money.
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
No, no, it's different.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
He can't stay up there.
Forget it.
Everything.
What about?
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
No, three. Who said there were four?
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
Someone lost the key.
OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
Two hundred pounds?
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
I should hope so.
It wasn't like that.
I'm boring?
That guy, the one that died.
That's what I thought.
A priest who dies.
It's a breeze.
That sounds fine.
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
I mean, that's what it's like.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Is it real?
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
Chicken salad, Devra!
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
Who?
Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
My keys.
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
It turned out to be cancer.
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
What?
I'm coming, baby --  How's Otis doing, anyway?
What kind of treatment?
You're looking great, baby.
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
I don't know. Just a minute...
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
Hello, George.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
Nobody can hear it.
Uh-uh.
It isn't?
I guess so.
Hello.
Hungry?
No thanks.
I do her hair, yeah.
... yeah.
What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
Have you ever made it with a girl?
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
Great.
Well, yeah... you know.
I've got heads here, Norman.
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
Great. Who's been doing your hair?
I'd cut it...
No, I'm sure.
Yeah... I mean great.
It's hot in here.
Do you? You still see him?
I won't screw you up.
You did, didn't you?
Yeah, baby...
What are you talking about?
Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
You don't do that anymore, do you?
No you didn't.
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
Nothing.
-- mmm --
Look who's talking.
Not me, pal.
-- you've got to leave.
It's too late...
What?
Wanda...
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
Wash her.
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
-- yeah, this is --
Well, it's a big canyon.  Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
What's gonna happen?
George, I don't --
Fine. How are you?
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
I am?
-- Sure.
Of course I like children.
What!
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Great.
About what?
Neither do I, baby.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
Oh, Christ.
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
Jesus.
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
Did you?
Did you?
-- A wash and set.
No?
Yes it is.
They're not?
What about, tonight?
Layered?
But...
Oh Jesus Christ.
What, do you think I planned it?
Didn't they tell you?
We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
No thanks.
Okay, thanks.
I know.
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
What?
Yeah.
I'll call you back.
You do?
-- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
George is going to open a shop.
I'm not jealous of the dogs.
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
Aren't you going to have one?
I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
I'll call you.
Who is that?
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
George is great but I know what you mean.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
Well yes -- you know that about George.
Well, there was this one time --
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
Didn't you have any panties on?
Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
Two weeks from tomorrow.
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
Jill.
No.
John...
-- we're going to be here all night.
Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
Yes?
No, Dad.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
How does he tell you things?
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
Yeah.
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
Advocaat is it?
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
And, er... where are they now?
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
Sure.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
What line of work are you in now?
Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet.  I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.  So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice.  You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not to busy, are you?
Thank you for saying so.
Your money's no good here.
Yes.
Yes.
When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Why?
Wendy!
Stop swinging the bat.
Give me the bat.
Go away.
Go away.
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
shut in together over long periods of time.
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
Well, it's very... homely.
Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Fine.
Eight thirty.
Fine.
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
What kind of noises?
Rats...
What?
Sure.
Yeah, I know. It's great!
Yeah... sure.
What the hell does that matter?
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
Marty, do you see your suspect?
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
But Uncle Al! You said-
Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
Perhaps.
I think they hear you!
Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..."  Thou shalt not.
Vince...
Today was the deadline, Vince.
You did what?
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you.
Joey -- do it.
Yes, Betty?
Oh-huh.
What is it, Betty?
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
Chops?
Because we're
This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
It's true -- I know her.
I knew that.
I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?
Wet behind the ears.
Amateurs 2
Again!
What?
I... I...
A novice.
Excuse me?
Experience!  Right?
Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.
She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
Enough joking.
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
You mean black people?
Can do.
No problem.
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
Your cell is more than adequate.
From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 
Mary Clarence!
Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
You have a phone call.
I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
I've been worried about you.
No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
I think they'd understand.
Hail, Mary.
Oh-huh.
Really.
They open a window.
Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
I'm telling you!
It didn't work, Vince.
Which one!
Willy -- hit the lights.
Neither did you!
For like, twelve zillion eternities?
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
However, we can also pray for other things.
That was exciting!
He's decent.
But how do we get there?
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
Two days... ?  For murder?
A diseased monster.
I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
... Brom Bones...
Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
And now Jonathan Masbath.
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
I did not ask you to, did I?
What kind of nuts?
How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
In test... what?
Baltus Van Tassel.
Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
Lady Van Tassel...
Take the reins.
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
There is no such thing as magic.
I insist that you have it.
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
What did you say?
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
What... ?
I can show exactly.
Yes.  Here...
May I see my mother?
She did not do it... please listen...
I can't remember.
Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
I like them french-fried potaters.
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
Please Doyle, don't.
But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
I hate you!
Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here.  That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine.
I aim to kill you with it.
Why? Hi, Karl.
I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
Two people.
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
Yeah, I recollect it.
They ort to. You're a good boy.
Naw.
I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
You will? For sure?
No sir.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
I've got a feelin' today.
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Okay.
Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
Nice to meet you, Karl.
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
I'm glad of it, honey.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
I reckon.
I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be.
Yes, I guess you are.
You better go get your things.
Naw.
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
Tolerable, I reckon.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Okay.
Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
How long have you been standing here?
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
I've heard it said that way.
Oh. How about before that?
I know.
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
Do you smell shit?
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
That's really strange. What does it mean?
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
Signs?
As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.
Why?
I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.
Better make it charge. 
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
What's the difference?
I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
Uh, better make it one.
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
You're looking good, Auggie.
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
Bully for you.
Five thousand bucks.
It's all yours, baby.
For keeps.
Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
What difference does it make?
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
Just passing through.
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
Say hi to Paul.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
That's how we met. We're members of the International Same Name Club. Believe it or not, there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America. But only two in the New York metropolitan area. That's how Paul and I got to be such good friends. We're the only ones who show up at the meetings.
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
Baby? And what baby is that?
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
Is your father an artist?
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
How long have you been here?
It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
I don't know. For helping me out.
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
You don't really want to know.
What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
Now ask him who his mother was.
Everything is real in here, honey.  As real as the color of my hair.
Oh, yeh?
Carl Heine's type.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
You done your math right.
No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size.  It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  Nobody does.
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
Why not?
Well, it seems to me...
Why?  We're only talking.
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
Carl Heine came.
Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  You'd <u>been</u> arrested, you <u>had</u> a lawyer, and you <u>still</u> claimed ignorance!
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
Three kids.  What's she going to do?
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
You're wondering why I held it.
Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
Fell.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.
Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.
Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
It is.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
Carl never lied.
I can't speak for him.
Such as?
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
All right, girls - from the top again.
Thank you ever so.
It's entirely mutual.

Manhattans?  This time of night?
What did he say?
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
Those two musicians from the garage!
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
I told you - it's a sure thing.
Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
Knock it off, will you?
And I'm Daphne.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
I got pinched in the elevator.
But this is so humiliating.
Don't get burned, Daphne.
You - you -
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
I'm engaged.
I am.
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Hello, Room 414?  This is the ship-to-shore operator - I have a call for Miss Sugar Cane.
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.
Terribly sorry.
That's ridiculous.
Isn't that ridiculous?
I have a very low resistance.
I'm fine.
I may spill something.
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
Thank you, Daphne.
Or was it Bryn Mawr?
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
Well, I'll come back later.
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
I hope so.
And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
- and you got to be girls.
I am Cinderella the Second.
I'm not surprised.
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
Wanna bet?
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
Yes, Osgood?
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
That's good thinking.  Daphne's a push-over for him.
Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
It's three weeks in Florida -
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
We'll take it!
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
No - funerals.
Don't get me started on that.  Want a drink?  It's bourbon.
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
You are?
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
Not very likely.
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
Well, I'm not.
Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before.  I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
It's been delightful meeting you both.
What?
They repealed Prohibition?
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
I am?
It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
It's the crews' night off.
Completely.
They just sort of leave me cold.
It's more like a mental block.  When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.
Have I?  I'm trying all the time.
That makes me feel just awful.
Have you ever tried American girls?
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
All right - if you insist.
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
That's because I've been on the wagon.
I never join nothin'.
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
Why?
Why wouldn't I?
You don't owe me no nothing.
No, Spats - no, no, no -  NO!
Pub Golf?
Actually, I do.
Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
Jeffrey told her last night.
Why, with you.
Im sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.
Mom, please.
I had to say something to get you here.
Dont be ridiculous. Its late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
What?
No.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.
And you do now?
Shrink, actually.
What?
Yeah?
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
I slept with your sister.
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. Thats why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
Kat.
You have feet?
I dont do naked. My sister? She does naked.
Love.
He was pretty drunk, but I think hes still crazy about you.
Its okay. Hell, Ive never paid for it. But please dont feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
Its cute.
You stand on your tiptoes.
I have a friend at the magazine.
Shampoo, got it!
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
First of all, its never out of the blue. And second of all--
Oh, come on. Youre like the Yoda of escorts.
Ive got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think its the words: morally repugnant.
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
Its my job.
Yeah.
I didnt say he was worth it.
What?! No, no. You cant--
You have more than one gynecologist?
You knew?
Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
Will do.
Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
Sometime, but not like this.
Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
Colored.
Sure--
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
Yes mam...
Nothin'...
What do that mean?
Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday--
Yes mam...
:His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
Yes, sir...
I think so...
Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
Mornin', Daddy...
September 4 -- how far away is that?
Nathan Lee Morgan...
Sunday...
Why don't you try and git you a new dog?
Listen, Mama...
He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
Good night...
I got to, Mama. I know Daddy wants to see him.
I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!
What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
I'll wait till after the children.
Little chilly.
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
Is that a blessing, Reverend?
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
I am the clitoris.
Dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
Doggy.
Very funny!
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
Okay.
Yeah,  <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!!</b>
Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
What?
Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-
I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
Sure, hon. Goodnight.
Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
Help yourself prickfuck!
Norwegian Ass Raper.
The rest of you are graduated. You can go home today.
Oh no, it's that kid.
Fallen one... We have such sights to show you!
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
Yeah, I guess.
For pooping, silly.
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Oh... Alright, back you go.
We can't leave without you!
It isn't fair!
Our moms suck!
How do we do that?
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
Yeah, so what do we say?
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
You bet, Terrance!
You would know, dummy.
I know, Terrance. I know.
Canada is saving us!!
You did? Just now?
You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
Hey, come here, guy.
I am.
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
Hey, relax guy!
<b>Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>
Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
That's nice, Stan.
Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
Cool!
Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Uh...
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
Will you transmit the distress signal?
Taylor, you surprise me.
Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
I know, I know.
The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
Will you shut up already?
Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
Just considering our options... sir.
So we did.
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
Yeah?
Helllp!
That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
Why?  Where are you going?
I can't!
You too.
It would matter to us.
Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
Is there anything I can help you with?
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
That is one of my priorities.
He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
Send it back if you don't want it.
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
One moment please...  one moment please...
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
What do you want with old man Faz?
Lemme see your ball.
Are you guys bruddas?
So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs.
Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
Theo.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
I'm your blood.
I gotta survive.
I couldn't care less.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
See ya 'round Maynard.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.
Cool!
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
You shouldn't touch her.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
I like the sport the way it is.
How Mr. Kastle?
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
Line up where you want it.
Whips...orange whips.
Won't your father help you with that?
No, not at all.
Not while I'm in training.
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
He said he'd sponsor me.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
Really? I kinda like it.
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
You got any broken bones?
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
It?
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
SSHHEEIILLAAA!
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
I'm looking for somebody.
Tell your little pal to let go.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
What is it?
What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
Two and a half days?
Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
What do we use for defense?
Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?
He's right beneath us.
That's our reserve air.
What team?
A thousand feet.
Geologists?
It's impossible.
It doesn't make any sense.
What's wrong with oxygen?
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
What do you mean, he's missing?
No "buts".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.
How drastic?
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
Nothing, sir.
What the hell is going on here?
Then how can it be chipped?
What?
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
He understands me fine.
She's not gonna know, sir.
Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
What are you going to do -- shoot her?
What is it?
Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
I love secrets.
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
What -- are you threatening me?
Get this thing off me.
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
Beth --
Beth.
We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
In case you die, too?
You don't trust me?
You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
Fixing it.
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
What?
Squids?
You think, in the sphere --
Valdomet.
Sintag.
Bingo.
Antibiotic.
It's a soporific.
Causes sleep.
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
I'll just boost the doses.
What do you mean, different?
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
It's either this... or I kill you.
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
Beth -- gimme the gun.
Hear what?
Beth --
A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
I never said that.
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
In time for what?
Just in time for what?
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
I'm fine.
To what?
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
Page 87 of what, Harry?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
Her suit's gone.
You didn't say that about the food?
I don't think so.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Shut up and catch.
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
Nine hundred feet to surface.
You mean forget?
Please.  It must have flown here --
Captain who?
Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
Who's going to pay me then?
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
I know that.
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
That's where my father was killed.
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
Did it occur to you they might find us?
It's automatic.
What are you saying?
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
Not if this tunnel deadends.
Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.
I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
With four casualties?!
You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
I read you sir.
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
I didn't see him !
He was our teacher... He was great.
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
I'm getting better.
Don't you have to finish the game ?
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
Funny...
A funeral.
Your turn...
Who ?
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
I'll meet you outside.
Good luck at the academy.
I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
Who cares ?
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
Did you get Starside R&D ?
My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
What happened to your eye ?
No way, ma'am !
Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
That's it, we're empty ma'am !
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
No thanks, Diz.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
I won't quit !
Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
Sir, yes it is, sir.
I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
The Rodger Young just burned up...
Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here-
Not a problem.
Been better, buddy.
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
What is it, Rico ?
Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
Good for you. Go find out.
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
Yes, sir...
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir !
That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner.
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
That is logical. You may procede.
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
Decker....!
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
Viewer ahead, sir.
Thrusters ahead, one third.
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
The point... 
... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
Dock signals clear, Captain.
Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
Tractor beam remains constant...
Annie...got an umbrella...?
He'll eat potroast and like it.
You bet your life.
Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.
I need a typewritter.
What's it called?
Don't be so hard on yourself.
It's in your play.
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
As the Old Mill goes around...
Of course.
You'd know better'n me.
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
He doesn't go back to the <u>mill</u>, he gets a second chance to go back to the <u>firehouse</u>...
Paperclip?
Better'n new, cause it's got a <u>story</u>. Want to do the other part?
I used to go out with a politician.
Sure did.
It used to be the Old Mill.
I hurt you?
...take <u>any</u> two people...
Hi.
What?
Is it...
That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
Carla was in the car, right?
...you think that's right...
Morning, darling.
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
No.  Don't tell me that.
Well, then, what's he doing here?
Courthouse back in town.
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
...they run on water.
On the coast?  Of <u>course</u> he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the <u>Hague</u>...
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
I'm having dinner with W...
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the world.
I don't eat vegetables.
I...
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Mr. Barrenger.
Mr. Bailey.
She's absolutely r...
Who is that...?
I...
I told her Thank You Very Much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because...
Yeah.
I can't do it, Walt.
It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
We, we have to give it.
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
I can't tell.
You said <u>three</u>...?
<u>Fuck</u> the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture...
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
What is the...?
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
He told you that...
...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.
Gut Yuntif.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
A witness to what...?
The writer.
Sure.
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.
You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
I can't find the writer.
I can only write on a manual.
That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...
Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
Why?
I hurt my finger.
The girl was in the car.
For what cause?
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
I can write it.  I can't type it.
I didn't say anything to them.
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...
I left that for you.
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
Later for that, Walt, let's get this:  we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"...alright?  We need a new title, we need a...
If you do the product placement...
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
Is he cool or angry?
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
And we're glad to have you here...
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
...it is?
Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...
...we can't lose the wind...
I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate.  I want to be a stud.
Sex.  Of course.
...why do you think?
I like talking about it.  At least, to you.
No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
She is but an arriviste.
Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
I'm not.
Yes.
And this is my room so get out!
He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!
Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
See, I...
You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
He'll be impressed.  The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
But Rache...
No.
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
Annabelle let's get something clear.
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
What honey?
Tomorrow?  Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
Is your bad?
So where are you?
No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
I'm worried.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Easy enough.
Not to me.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
Look, I...
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
Anxiety.
Yes?
Nobody likes a snoop.
How the hell would you know?
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
See, I know that.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
You mean, after I'm dead?
Are we.
Don't be too sure.
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Give 'em my number.
Oh please.
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
I didn't want to spoil our supper...
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
I think so...What do you think?
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
I know that.
Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing for me, Jack.  Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able.  It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules.  When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
Does Jackie know this?
Oh.
He was in a concentration camp?
We had to work. My family was poor.
He's dead.
He wasn't.
Nothing, I guess
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
Got a lot of homework?
Is everything OK?
Fine.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
You know he hated my story also.
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...
I'm going in there.
Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?
The same.
Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about.  You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
Tired of this shit...
Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
What are you doing here?
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
Any books you like to read for fun?
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
Oh, fine. How are you?
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Maybe she has caller ID.
No, I don't think so...
Yeah. I know.
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
But what did you get on your SATs?
Well, I-I hope that--that--
Why? Are we going dancing?
Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager:
Who's got matches?
We're outta here--
What happened!
I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
What happened?
What are you talking about?
Well Cooper...
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
I said I don't want any, goddammit!
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.
Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
He's in there...
Chemco is willing to deal with him, meet his demands.  I can have the money there in an hour.
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.
Excellent...excellent!
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
I say we head out.
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
Dissent?
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
Don't be ridiculous.
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.
The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
See!  See, I told you.
The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi.  R...T...T...There's only three combinations of -- T...T...R, or T...R...T...
Look, I didn't shoot him!
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
That's government property, Major.
What did you say?
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
This is General Ripper speaking.
No, sir.
No, sir.
General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
Perfect.  Thank you, Major.  And now let's drink a toast.
Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.
What the hell is Plan-R?
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
Admiral Buldike?
Naturally I am, sir.
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.
Roger. One-three-eight.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
War?
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
Maximum ECM!
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Sure, I'll take her up right now.
Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.
Very interesting.
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
Listen, give me a shot quick!
Why should they call us back?
Right.  So how could we get any messages?
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
Yeah.
Sure, all the time, in Group.
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Yeah.
What did you guys think?
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
What's it about?
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Now?
Yeah.
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
So you can do an album cover?
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
No.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
Erica is in the van back there.
I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"? Been on the road opening for "Midnight Hore". Stadiums, man.  Wait, so Pony's coming by here?
So, how was the ride, kids?
Hey.
Shit.
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Oh, you were there?
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
What'd he get you?
Oh, yeah?
You cut off your little finger?
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
Funny shit, man.
Pony and I are friends.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Sooze wants to see him.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
You don't know?
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
Look, your trespassing.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Nazeer Chaudry!
I hate that.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
But do you stand for anything?
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
I would've stopped it.
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
Sooze.
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
You do.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
God, you smell like whiskey.
Oh, fuck it, man!
'Bye, Jeff.
Just go.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
So how's college?
Yeah, really.
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
Burnfield. No place like it.
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
What are you saying?
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
It's pretty exciting.
New York, huh?
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
You done?
I can't believe you're still here.
Mm-hm.
Yep.
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
"I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
It's none of my business?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
At least I have a point of view, you know?
Hey, Tim.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
Oh that's nice for you.
Sorry, Kansas...
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
Bye.
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
And they get caught!
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Y'think?
But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.
Jack...
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
Huh?  Oh Jesus...
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
Sorry.  My hands are tied.
I'll just ask the question myself... "Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?"
We're here for you, Diane.
He is the Great One...
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
I-I'm sorry - can someone else please run the Ouija board?  It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
Kansas?
Thanks!  That'd be great.
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
Maybe we can make a deal.
I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
Now how the hell can I help you?
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
Hi, Artie.
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
I just think pictures should say a little something.
Why, you sweet kid.
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
You'll be waiting for me?
Why should you do that?
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
Twenty-two.
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
Whose house is it?
Whose?
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
Why?
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
Fair enough.
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
I've lost my car.
What's wrong with It?
Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
Who?
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
"Mad about the boy."
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
What right do you have to take me for granted?
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
Good night.
I think I'll read a little.
Why do you say that?
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
No, they don't.
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
Goodbye.  Norma.
Madame is waiting.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
Good.
It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
There are no locks anywhere in this house.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
Frankly, no.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
Yes.  Madame.
Who?
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
Thank you, Max.
Sorry, mistress.
Eliminate her.
Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
Later.
Why not ?
Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
What do you feel about me?
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
But why?
You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
Yes.
Do you want to come to Argo City?
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
What an adorable hat.
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
Well...I guess I can't.
George---I thought you'd never ask.
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
Did anybody notice you?
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
She's a beast.
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
I'm Linda Lee.
Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.
No, MR. Danvers.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
I know.
Criminals.
What? Palace? Hardly.
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
Brad.
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
Nope.  Never. 
Clark.
It sure is.
But Lana, you could --
I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
No, thanks.
Me neither...
Old ties are hard to cut.
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
What!
We get together sometimes.
Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
Nope, but --
Who gets it, the company?
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
That what they call you?
Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
Just the man I wanted to see!
Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
What will it get me?
Tell me more...
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
Watch out for them air pockets!
That's his sister. Vera Webster.
A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
But the other night...
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Diet soda?
53!
You've got to pick three more numbers.
Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
Hello.
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
Storms! Floods!
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Be my guest.
In July???
Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
Maybe you wanted to.
Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
We'd better talk.
I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .
Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
My kind of people.
I asked the right question.
North.
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
What do you want?
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
It will. Starting with your own.
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
I really don't think . . .
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
What about here?
No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
I'm sorry to see you go.
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
N-no...I mean...you bet.
Stuff it.
Superman gets mail here?
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
Our other dinner guest.
He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
You're just an experiment, freako!
I made you, and I can destroy you.
What do you fear?
Destiny.
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
I've been on the job.
It was hot, yes.
North. It's north
No.
What the  --  !
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
I read the article.
Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
I know...
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
I'm wearing it.
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
Gets you where you live, huh?
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
Folks'll ask question.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
There are none of them any good anyway.
Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
Right on the first guess.
Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
Uh-huh.
Pink.
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
I...uh...check.
Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
Of time, Luthor.
They'll soon be over.
For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
Which clinic?
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
Yes.  Do you find there's something strange about this meat?
Alison.
I'll tell her that.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...
Goodnight, Nicole.
Billy, please.  The children.
She's resting.  In her room.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
Can't you make it later?
When the game's over, I guess.
It's natural.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
Good night.
Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
And they loved Bear.
Berries.
Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
It's interesting.
Yes.  It's a present.
It's the truth.
Was he drinking?  Could you tell?
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
I won't lie.
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
People who will help our cause.
There's the Prescots...
What do they do?
Daddy?
Don't you want to hear?
Yes.
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
Is there shrimp on it?
You can't come here.
Who did they get for that?
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
Excuse me?
Do you have this agreement with you?
Yes.
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
Before the actual accident?
Dolores was driving too fast.
No.
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
Very slick.
But you didn't lose me.
Great.
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
Yeah, right.
Hitler!
Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
See my mother?
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.
I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
Hurry back.
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
Why?
J.J., Steve isn't...
Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
Now don't kid a kidder.
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
Ha!  My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!
Can't hurt...
No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  The manager yes, but not the boy.
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
Don't go wild, Sidney.
But not for anything I did today...
Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
What about?
At the bar - Sidney...
In his apartment -
That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
What kind of an act is this?
I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
He wants me to break a leg?
But what?
It won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?
Help me with two minutes of silence!
Yes.
Begging your pardon, I haven't been down the bowery in years!
Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here -
Why not you?
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
Yes, but why?
Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
No, you had me eating that Chinese food!...
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
Now listen to me very carefully.
You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
I would.
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
Cool.
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
No.
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
I'm sorry, John.
I have to go away, John.
I order you not to!
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
And what it that?
You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
Open the goddamn door!
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
Why him?
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
Eating is eating... and...
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
I guess it's possible.
Yes.
Five minutes.
Why not show Dr. Furtwngler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
Furtwngler's in a different category.
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
No can do.
Yes.
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
May I ask a question?
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwngler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
I wish to say something.
And what was that?
And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
And what happened to Von der Nul?
You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Me? Never.  Never.
That's what I asked.
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
Yes.
They said I was dogged?
He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
You know your weapons, buddy.
You're a big help.
What's it to ya?
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
The what?
Kyle.
Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
I volunteered.
It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
About where you're from.
What about it?
That's the way it was told to me.
Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
No.  I'm not.
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
You're not supposed to.
Cover...our footsteps...
Yes.
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
Like shit, boss.
Projections were far too optimistic.
No.  This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet.
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
I said I was sorry...
Oh, no... you.
A game?
Where are you going?
Why not?
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
Hm?  Oh, yes.
I thought...
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
You?
Get out.
No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
Yeah?  I was your waitress on your birthday.  Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember?  I was already playing my part, <u>before</u> you started the game.
Who the fuck cares?
Scams, con games.  How many?
You call them...
Stop it!
Big family... small?
Studied acting, I assume?
Boyfriend?
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
Which grad-school?
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
Yeah.
You shouldn't have.
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
Fun?
Okay.
I said I would...
Are you still on mediction?
You dodged a bullet.
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
Yes.
There's nothing to forgive.
I'll call.  I really will.
What kind of vacation?
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Have we met?
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
Did you worry about him?
Goodnight.  Where was she?
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
Look, where is he?!
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Don't ask.
Follow me.
It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?
I did okay.
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
Why?
There's a carriage house around back.
Do we still get paid for the week?
Just stay there, Nell!
And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic.  Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry...
It was very specific.
It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on.  Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
Good.
How could you do this to people?
I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
Oh!  You scared me.
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?
No one will come any nearer than that.
Fifteen dollars.
I don't know what you mean.
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
What's his first name?
I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
-- What do you think?
Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
Just had to be sure.
Like you.
Oh, god.
Who?
We all did.
We think?
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
Yeah?
Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
Huh?
No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
This ain't your lot?
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
Not much -- you?
Probably.
No, but I know what he means.
Hard to miss.
You look alike.
Try calling me again.
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
Not embarrassed.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
My employer.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
Why not.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
Just now?  Overnight?
I've 'ardly ever left it.
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
What about your grandmother?
Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
How do you know?
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
And that is?
He had urgent business in the north.
No kidding.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
Sounds like you need a rest.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
You bet.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
Walked.
I doubt it.
I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
I don't want you here, Terry.
Susan.
-- You know his name is Frank.
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
Hello, Tony.
Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
That's what he keeps telling me.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--
I don't understand.
I'll have it in a week.
Way out of line.
Cash.
Yeah.
Look, uh... Creighton...
What is it, Dave?
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
But it's...
...Huh?
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Who?
Honey...
It was Big Dave's.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
So... who... who actually--
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
Yeah, yeah--go home.
Huh?
Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
What the--
...Nah.
Yeah.
That's very generous.
Uh-huh.
Hello, Walter.
Crane. Ed Crane.
Could you come with me please?
Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
Uh... you're under arrest.
Great.
I'm in.
Why not?
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
What's the combination?
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
What doors?
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
Call me Vince.
Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
You're kidding.
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
Dr. John Whittlesley.
I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
I don't believe it.
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
What are they?
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
Big as a house.
Like this.
He's right.  Follow me.
Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
What kind of hormones?
Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.
A monster?
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
I don't know.
Where did you see it?
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
<i>A month.</i>
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
Why wouldn't I?
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
What's to see?
What music?
That and a fat, new contract.
It has to be the reality.
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
Certainly a nomination.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
<i>You</i> were real.  That's what made you you so good to watch.
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
Oh, yes.
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
No?  Really?  Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza.  How about Friday?
Yeah?  Outta what?
You think so?
--Truman, what are you doing here?
I told you I can't.
This is where it started.
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
I think I'm going to stay up for a while.
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
How do you know?
I'm sorry, I'm late.
So why do you want to go?
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
You blaming me for the traffic?
I bet you did.
Oh, just so.
They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
I'll try.
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
You can count on it.
You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
You're not FBI agents.
When was that?
Yes.
Brought on by what?
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
I know the name. Why?
Before the bomb went off?
They want to discredit you -- for what?
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
Get dressed, Scully.
Evidence of a massive infection.
I don't know.
It looks pretty green for this climate.
We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
I need you on this, Scully --
I think... something stung me.
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
General McAddie's.
She was with me.
-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
Where's Scully?!
I've got to find Scully.
The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
What alien environment?
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
No.
Okay.
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
Why did we stop?
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
What happened?
I don't need them anymore...
You don't know the procedure.
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
What difference does it make...?
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
's broken.
Mocky-Lock.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
That hoist, with the winch...
Sometime yesterday morning.
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
Absolutely.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.
I don't have to.
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
I was told there were only two men there.
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
Tell you what?
We're both in it, Harry.
Wait here.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
A parrot...Let it go.
He told you, didn't he?
Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
They're Harry's.
Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
Yes, of course.
Can I have that woman's passport?
I can't say that I have.
Best thing that ever happened...
It wasn't petrol.
Well, you could say that murder was part...
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
No.
How about the doorway?
Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
She's right. It's none of my business.
All right, Calloway. You win.
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
Take him to Sacher's.
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
I've heard of him, of course, but I didn't exactly know him.
It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
Of course, of course, of course.
Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
What is it, Sergeant?
Have you, Sergeant? Author - Martins. Thank you, Sergeant.
Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
It's good to see you, Holly.
She's been arrested.
You wouldn't do anything.
Coffee.
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
Coming to the point, please.
I understand...
English?
Who else?
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
Now, hold on.
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
Not when I get interested.
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
So?
So how many miles do you think it is?
We're ok.
I'm sorry.
Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
Fuck off.
Sshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake him. He thinks I waste film taking photographs of the sky.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
Richard, you know something -
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
Killing himself.
No.
No.
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
You eat first, then you light.  Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
What about Curtis Zampf?
I agree.
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
What??!?
Female...
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
Get the fuck away from me.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
You're lying.
I can't say that.
Fucking kike.
Yes!
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
What kids?...
Who told you that?
Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.
You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
The mother.
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
Just do it.
Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
Why me?
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
What are you trying to say?
Do I give a shit?
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
Danny, please, we don't want to know.
Eat shit....
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
Congratulations.
What was he like, when he was little?
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
Lira?
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
Have the car painted.
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
No...
That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... I'll see you there...
How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
People say that?
What?
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
Look at me.  These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks.  How long can you hold your breath?
So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you.
... Yes.
I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
... Okay.  I'll try.
Thank you...
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
Uh... Yes, of course!
Why?
Uh... Ah!  A story?
... Not at all.
Absolutely positive.
You go back, I'll walk.
I saw how it has to be.
Anything.
I brought Johana to meet you.
No, no.  Johana is visiting me.
Again?
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
Haven't you been listening?
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.
One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
It's Esther.
Yeah, no kidding.
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
Mazel Tov!
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.
But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
I'm just calming the kiddies.  There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
Why not?
That depends. How much money has he?
Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
What about me?
It don't look like a leopard to me.
I drink.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
What do you want to see him for?
You found the leopard!
That's the place: I remember - My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
Who?
Go on -
Let me see it 
You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
Hey  I'm over here.
Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in "Zaza." After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out.
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
That's right, of course.
Yes?
I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
To know where that leopard went -  I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little freshwater college back East. I gave that up.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
No - really, I can see them -- they're coming now - turn off the lights 
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
I don't know  a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
We will 
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
You a tourist?
Will you please come with me?
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble.
Excuse me?
Oh no. Youll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight Im convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
Paul Lamont...?
Why... I dont know what youre talking about.
No!
My brother hung himself.
Leon could still have hung himself.
Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.
Good.
You bastard...
I didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Something like that.
Simplify and damn.
Should I?
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
A call box? Thats odd. Where exactly?
Can you tell me how you spell...
French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didnt have any. I used a British passport. My names not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
A criminal?
Italian? The Mafia...?
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For gods sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
What about your friendly cop?
Shell be alright. Shes tough...
Have we done business before?
Yeah.
What about an untrained pup, white...
What...?
You... Fuck you!
Finsbury Park. Were in Finsbury Park.
I dont know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I dont know where the kids are... I work for Martin, thats all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. Hes got a safe...  I need a doctor...
No.
La what?
Well, I hope youre not too heartbroken and...
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, trs bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandmes services quelquun rcemment... Vous tes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one Id given you and then got back, remember? I cant find it. Do you know where it is?
What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
Spitz. We spoke on the telephone.  My husband...  My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is.  My son-in-law, Carlos...  The gentleman is a business partner of his. 
Recommended?
Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
Do what, Mr Lombard?
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonards address, keys and other things you might need. 
My rates...
Anything at all?
Does it matter?
Is my money in there?
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Huh. Id have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientle. Get rid of them and were out of business.
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Dying without ever reaching the top...
I dont recollect mentioning a friend.
An Austrian.
Yes. You wouldnt know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
How are you, Rhian?
Should I be?
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
Oh, I... She just moved. Ive got her new... Its in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
The nineteenth... How come you didnt know?
Er... Yes...
He... Apparently the hostility was all hers. Leon didnt... It hurt him. They used to be close...  Their parents were in their forties when they were born, you see. And mostly away. They grew up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He... Our world was so old and cold, we shone for one another, Leon used to say. His sister cut him off after she got married. He never understood why but thought it was because she had no children. Was bitter...
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
... No.
... No. In fact, Id seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasnt getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
I know his work better than I know him.
Who?  I dont know who the fuck youre talking about, sunshine.
Glucks dead, you sonofabitch!
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didnt you know?
If he had, youd be dead.
What do you think, huh?
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman whod called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
My lord, I'm not sure that...
Of course I am, it's just that...
No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
They've started the battle without me!
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
Well...
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
But... why... what's the point?
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
I -- I don't understand...
You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
I tried to.
I don't know...
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
Scared of a girl?
Where... where am I?
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
In a village called Domremy.
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
Not unless you hear my confession.
Not unless you hear my confession.
And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
Praying.
You have nothing to regret...
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
You really think she's been sent... by God?
But... her army's so small now...
You did well...
... You look wonderful...
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
His face.
Yes... they were.
We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
We need another ten minutes...
Not yet.
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
Damn right!
Me too...
No... not like this...
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
No!
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
I said, kneel!
I might ask you the same question.
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory...
In His name??
Do you think this cross will protect you?
I don't think so.
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
Do you think you are ready?
I need to confess again.
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
And what does he say to you?
Jeanne, be patient.
Yes.
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
He'll be back before curfew.
Dead.
Let's find out.
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
What?
What?
Thanks.
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
It certainly was.
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
So, what's the news?
There are always notices going up.
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
Cow!
I was listening, Kitten.
Out of Warsaw. Where?
I am... I was a pianist.
In the attic.
It will be very dramatic.
Yes, like a cave.
No sound at all?
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
I don't want to learn.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
No, not words.
I just want to listen.
She says, throw the piano overboard.
It must come.
Tomorrow.
Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
What do we do?
Here.
Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
Don't worry about it, pal.
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
If that's the way you want it.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
Shove off, Duff.
Which one?
Hackers.
Yes sir.
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
We'll get by without 'em.
Well we got some workin' money anyway.
He'll show.
I thought I'd lost him.
Then why you doin' it?
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here.  You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?
Nice work, J.J.
Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.
What!  Don't give me that crap you little weenie.  How do I know you ain't gonna take a powder.  You come to a game like this, you bring your money.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
Where's June today?
No.  What's wrong with the front?
He'd like to kill me.
How ya doin', Jimmy.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
Then why the rat?
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.
660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
I am after this race.
Give 'em a little time.
You're a lucky man, all right.
I didn't get the bet down in time.
No.
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
For fifteen years.
Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
Sorry.  Don't know a thing.
He was?
Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
Another young man.
That is, if it's all right with you.
Do you think I care
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
Dorothy!
Nothing.
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
There!
Now do you believe me!
And I'll give then proof!
Oh, thank heaven.
He's been dead for three months.
Yes, she would.
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
Where are you going?
He's all right.
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
What's he want of you?
What's that to you?
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
Well, what?
He did!
No.
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
Go ahead!
What did you do with the rest?
I haven't been a detective for four years.
Slim.
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it?
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Much better, thanks.
What are you drinking?
Yes.
Maybe a drink would help you.
All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?
Want a drink?
Come on, Watson, we're going places.
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
No.  Nobody but you.
Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
I know I left them there.
Home!
Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
Wha...
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
Maybe we should split it up now.
Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.
He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
I out rank you, that's why.
What if I do?
What about Jaeger?
I have to answer him.
It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
Knock it off!
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.
Wait.  Wait.
Roger that.
Wh-what do you think--
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
Just be cool.
Just relax.
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
Just stay down.
They can't shoot us in here.
So where do we start?
Jesus, Jaeger.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
Makes two of us.
Damn.
If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
Shi'ites, I think.
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
Yeah.
Thought you were going to buy a car.
I don't know.
People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
Yeah, you're funny.
Naw, nothing.
I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.
What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
It doesn't mean anything.
Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
What?
Oh, no.
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
How the hell should I know how much?
Oh, God!
Oh, Jesus!
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
Then lets go back while we still can.
You have to go with us, Wes.
That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
He lived through that?
The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
What happened?
What's the matter with you?
Now.
Looks like dirt.
But...you...
I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.
No one can see us now we're alone.
I've said many times before, and I guess I'll have to repeat it again for your...
It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind, but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.
On the contrary!  It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits.  We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth.  We must continue the search.
What?
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
But you can't...you.
That way.
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
No......  She's dead THX........
I'm only trying to help you.
What do you want?
I thought of something.....
I did not accept any.  I...  I wanted... to.  But I didn't. You know I didn't.  Don't you?
-Where?
No thanks, Bev.
Anything else I should know?
Hey, look--
Then let's go see what they missed.
I don't know. You tell me?
Cream of the crop, huh? You?
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Look, it's a longshot...
Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... 
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
Be right back.
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Off the scale.
Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel.
Don't touch that.
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
What? Nobody, I-
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
Look, it's important.
That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
Shit. We're fucked.
Fuck factor ten.
Yeah, just a nick ...
What?
Captain assigned me to assist you.
IRA - instant retirement account.
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
That feeling won't last long.
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
No!
Amsterdam?
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
The type they marry.
Smart. London, eh?
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
Um-hum ...
No, not at all!
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out <u>with</u> the Bank of Constantinople?
Gaston Monescu.
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
Sweetheart, what day is today?
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
Spanish passports?
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
Lily!
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
Yes.
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
Oh! You didn't read it!
Oh!
Too much blue in crimson.
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
You think that's too much?
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
You would?
I <u>must</u> go.
On the night table.
Please! 
Call the police?
Yes, Gaston?
What is it, madame?
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
Yes, madame!
I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to-- 
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
Well--uh--yes and no.
Very well, madame. Thank you. 
Ever had a romance with a crook?
He started it.
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
Well, where is it?
The pumps --
An hour, two at most.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
Don't drop it Rose.
It's hers, you schmuck.  Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.
I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
So do I.
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
You wanted to see the propellers?
Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
Not the better half.
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
Bollocks.
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go.  Well come on!
You're crazy.
Jack.
Just some sketches.
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
No, no! Just with her hands.
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
A mistake?
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
You're right. Only you can do that.
Sssshh. Come here.
This is crazy.
He couldn't have.
We'll find out.
You think she was really there?
I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.
Charmed, I'm sure.
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
This is Miss Marsh.
Will you leave me alone?
Glad to see you again.
Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise.  Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
I don't understand.
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
Not at all.
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
Very much--
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
Good-by.
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
But I'll have cocktails with you.
Sorry.
Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
Decent?  I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
You said it! How about a little action?
Lonesome?
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
How're the tips?
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
What is it?
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
Why?
I should say not.
In New York.
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
No. <U>Knots</U>!
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
Well, did you find me?
That's fine.
Who won?
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
Yeah--
Everything O.K.?
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
What's he got that I haven't got?
Eh?... Oh.
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
Thanks to me.
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
Telegrams.
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
Not now.  I don't have time.
Well I'm not so go home.
Oh, Jesus, Johnny...
Good.  That's real good.
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.
Well... 'bye.
You retired, too?
Credat Judaeus Apella.
In pace requiescat.
Enough?  Never.
Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right As the mail.
Forgive me if I don't shake hands.
But who was the Devil?
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
No...
I don't know.  It all happened so Fast.  If I'd had a chance to Think about it I guess I probably Would've been scared but... Swear To God, Doc, I just don't know.
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
What?
You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.
What?  But I saw 'em-
Wyatt, are you crazy?
Colorado's closer
Easy now... That mare's in season.
I laugh sometimes
What about her?
Where do you get these questions?
How would you know?
Wyatt...
All right, well, good night.
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
I don't know.  I'm all right.
I need it.
You wanted to talk?
If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
Drop his horse.
So he can tell the story.
Might as well hear him out. Anyways, what choice we got?  But no matter what happens, see It through to the end.  If you don't I'll curse the day I ever laid eyes on you.
Hope so.  Clean up with this boy.
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
Morg, use your head.
Jack...
Doc's just in no kinda shape.
Hit a streak when we left.  Him And Kate.
Acquired?
Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's Where I leave you.
Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.
Yeah, and dangerous.
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
We'll see about that.
Sir Elliot.
Sightseeing.
Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.
I'm sorry.
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
- Four wheel drive?
Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
Do you?
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
How is old Q?
Not from forty feet.
Hey - the world is my office.
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
Thanks.  Take care -
I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
What?
No. I'm going with you.
My father left me the business.
Are you listening to me?
Don't say it.
If not?
Now.
Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
Only what I read in the newspapers.
Good luck on your mission, 007.
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
You leave me no alternative.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
I see you two have met.
Approaching the first gate.
I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
Thank you sir! Thank you!
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
Soon as I rest a bit.  I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
I'm okay. Go back to your friends.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
Now how far would further out be?
Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
You all act like two roosters.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
Hush.
No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.
Just stay in bed and rest.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
It's healing now.
He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
Everything these days is made overseas.
It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.
All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything.
She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
Tolerable well.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
You must have done something to her.
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.
If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
You can bring ONE toy...
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Where was the last place you left him?
But what if we leave them behind?
Let's let Molly open one.
Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
T-O-Y.  Toy.
What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
That's why.  Sid.
No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
Then we've no time to lose!!
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
Go away.
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
Shield your eyes!
Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Don't tell me what to do!
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
Look out!!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
I got dibs on his hat!
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!
Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
Come on.  Let's get out of here.
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Last present!
Uh-oh.
Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
No, Slink --
Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
There's no mirror.
Home is where the heart is.
Is that all?
Do what?  Oh, I see.
Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
In my pocket.
It was only a mouthful!
Nothing is left but us.
Storms?
Juliet who?
Victoria -
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
I want to believe you.  I really do.
Why are you talking like that?
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --
Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
What?
Me, too.
She asked me not to.
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
Will we get invited to the White House?
Yes.
Cincinnati Country Day.
Yeah.
Who do you work for?
She ain't in on it.
I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
Yes, sir!
You don't?  Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
I don't believe you.
That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
We keep our mouths shut.
But will he be house-trained?
If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
What do you look for?
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
I have money --
I don't know what to say.
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
What kind of research?
No. On you go.
Bit fucking late, like.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Aye, OK, Fr.  But the good times couldn't last for ever.
Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?
I'd fucking kill you.
Thanks.
I'm going home.
It's where I live.
think I left something back at the -
No, not holding hands.
Easy for you to say.
Are you clean?
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
Unless you get caught.
So why have you told me about it?
Well, he's young and he's healthy.
He forgot. Useless motherfucker.
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
No.
No, I'm clean.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
Lewis Gilbert.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
What do you mean?
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
It wasn't that bad.
He made me lick it.
You're all hear.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
you'll need one more hit.
Your favourite dish.
Stick it on my tab.
Yeah.
Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.
It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
He doubts me.
All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time.
Plotting our new course.
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
I don't have a clue.
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
Oh, please.
Understood. Kirk out.
I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
If we could send a distress signal...
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
I cannot be certain.
Why?
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
The emergency channel, open.
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
Not possible. You were never alone.
I'm afraid of nothing.
I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
Because you, too, must know.


Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
Okay, okay...
For being on to Dillinger.
I'm certainly not.
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
The Pentagon?
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
Yeah, I... oops!
How about you?
Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.
Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy?
Let's get some power here.
Probably.
Sure, a little disorientation. That's normal, when they transport you. It'll come back to you. You're doing real well in training. Remarkable, really...
Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
Little more juice's all it needs...
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.
Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
We have to.
I had to...in the games...
It's something Users do.
Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows we exist.
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
You're kidding.
Okay.  Let's step up the surveillance on her.  Put on two more guys.
Yes.
I thought you moved out.
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							*
And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the way in.
No!  Never!
That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
Yes what?
Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
Oral hygiene?
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
My husband the hero.
They must've just missed me.
I can't, honey.  I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry.
He needed my help.
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
Yes.
Do you still love your husband?
The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--
No.  Doris.
What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
I'm not wearing any.
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
Yup.										*
No.  Much more.
And you've got one.
I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great.
Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
It's serious.  That's all I can				* say.  Just meet on K Street under				* the Key Bridge.  At eight sharp.				*
I'm married!
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
Find out who this Renquist it.
Wait a minute -
Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
The letter he sent.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
I took a cab.
How 'bout me what?
Where are you from.
What's your favorite movie star?
Would you like a bite of my pie?
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
What?
What?
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
She's with me.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
Tell me.
Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
Elliot Blitzer.
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
Two guys.
In case.
I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it.
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
What are we gonna see?
They'll be along.
I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
Nope.
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?
McTeague.
Thank you.
Sure. No problem.
Absolutely.
Uh-huh.
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
How the fuck could he know?
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
Read my lips.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
Do you know where we can find him?
Uh, what?
No, sir!  I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  And I have the experience, I know who the people are...
We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.
This is it, James...what you've been working for.
Shut up!
I need to go.
What?
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
Who's keeping an eye on you?
I've got one now.
You have to give yourself up, you know.
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
I...I...We need cash, James.
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, "voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
What's that mean?
Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
I'm here about some monkeys.
Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole.  Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.
Yes, sir.
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
You really want to know?
Might be tight.
Yeah, yeah.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
We was born to die, boy.  From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  You just don't know where, or when, or how.  Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars.
Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
Hundred and eight already.
Will be.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
Out of here.
I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
How much.
Yep.
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
You believe that?
What?
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
What's it to you?
You got beer?
Let me have a Beck's.
Genuine Draft?
Yeah, give me the Miller.
Yes.  Yes it is.
Wrong number.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
The wind isn't blowing.
What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
My cup runneth over, beauti--
What happened to your hand?
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Did you like it; me watching you?
Like they're made of polyester.
Games?
No.
Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
Kill someone.  I can't do it.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
Are you sure?  About me, I mean?
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
Where are you going?
I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!
Now what?
But you said we could be together.
Grace!
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
A lot that means.
John Stewart.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
Just ran into a little trouble.
No.
I had a problem getting my car back.
About things.  About your wife.
I do.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
I need thirteen.
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
Darrell giving you problems?
That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
Come on, Jake--
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
I said come on!
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--
What the hell are you talking about?
Will you shut up!
Get away from me!
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
I guess.
I don't understand what the--
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
Sure you do.  Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house.  It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  Not for lack of trying.
Senor, you need a doctor.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
...And everything is nothing too.
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
Oh, shit!
You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Grace, tell him.
Bobby Cooper.
About things.  About your wife.
About what you said this morning.
How do you want it?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
I've had time to get over it.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Time.
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
You've been there?
You believe that?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
What?
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
Eh?
No! No police.
Maybe I don't want you to.
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
What happened to your hand?
I just drove in this morning.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
I guess it must.
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
Because I know you're full of shit.
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
But we all need that too. Hold him.
And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?
Which you don't have.
Where to?
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
I'm sorry.  It's just ... you know ...
No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
Sure, I'll try.
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
No baby, you got it wrong.
Wrong number.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
Yes.
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
I'll keep it in my office room.
He's asleep.
Do you remember me getting sick?
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
No that's it.
Oh.
You use your sleeve.
What was that?
Skeptical about what?
In college. A car accident.
We've already begun.
Are you for real?
You thought he was carrying a knife?
But not a knife?
Have you ever tried to develop it?
I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
Yes he is.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
Two hundred and seventy.
Get mom.
I see.
Know what?
Jeremy listen to what--
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
Is David Dunne there?
Okay.
How did you get together?
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
Where is it?
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
We was... lyin'.
What wife? He don't have no wife.
I told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow.
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
'Course he's coming.
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em... an I says, "Skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this" an' I says, "Bill's sleepin', Skinny," an'...
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
Three days. Are you hungry?
You want... a free one.
Your wife?
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
He admit it?
You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
Is... is it... loaded?
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
I could of... easy.
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Huh?
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
I didn't see nothin' planted.
How far kin you see?
Yeah... you said that last night.
I know it's rainin',  Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
Huh? Uh... yeah.
He's dead, Bill.
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river.  He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
We got to kill this other one first.  Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
Nothin's bent.
Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
Yeah?
He's blind, for Chri...
How many you killed, Kid?
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
Just like that?
Yeah?
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
I hope I didn't disturb you.
A glass of water would be nice.
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
You are a criminal.
Can we stealth these guys?
I can run. I got no problem with that.
Did you hear what he just said?
County. I was in for fraud.
I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
You okay?
Who's Keyser Soze?
Mr. Soze will be most -
Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
Someplace else, then.
Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
I'm not a rat.
What lawyer?
The D.A. gave me immunity.
Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
Why didn't you say anything?
I don't.
But Keaton...
Edie.
Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone.  She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends --and the people who should care for her:  her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way.  We have been paid to look the other way.  I came in here to take your money.   I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.   I can't take it.  If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.    I can't do it. I can't take it.
Mickey told me to come back to work.
It looks that way.
What does it mean?
When she...
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Yes!
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
Just as you are, Sir...
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
Objection.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
Yes.
I . . ..
I thought I would need it.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
... that's all right.
I completely understand ...
It's completely done on a contingency basis.  That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ...
Why is that?
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Well...
...What difference would...
Yes?  Galvin, right?
... and you're going to do that?
... that's perfectly all right.
To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
No.
Why is that?
...things change.
Thank you for seeing me.
What?
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
Mr. Alito, please.
...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I understand.  Thank you, my name is Galvin.  I'll be at the following number in a half an hour.  It's urgent.
Kathy Price.
Still looking.
Yes.  It was, actually.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
I think I will.
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Do you want me to go...?
If I don't 'grow up...'
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
What do you want?
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
No.
Right.
I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
I can't talk now.
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
Hi.  How are you doing?
...everybody.  Mike says, `Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?'  `That's correct.'  Mike says, `Pat.  Have you been in this bar ?'  Pat says, `No, but my sister has ...'   Everyone.  Buy yourself one too.
Thanks, Franky.
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
How'm I doing so far?
Me, too.
San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power...  the freedom.
No, I'm all right.
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
Well?
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
What happened?
Did she hurt herself?
What for? Who are you?
Your name. And --
But you haven't lived here long.
No.
I just want to see you as much as I can!
No.
Honest?
But Scottie, you don't have to!
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
They're none of them right.
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
Madeleine died here.
Scottie --
You can't. You're afraid!
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
My name is John Ferguson.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
No... this is the first time for me, too.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
Not at all, I enjoyed --
Shopping?
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
Here with you.
A grave...
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
Why? What's happened?
Only this far.
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
Yes?! But --
Let me go.
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
I won't lose you.
Why?
Yes... you run this hotel.
Does she sleep here? Ever?
What's tomorrow?
More than you think.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
I've never run across one like that.
Normal.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Okay.
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Yeah.
All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
And she died...
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
What is it, a still life?
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
How?
But you said grey, sir.
Can we have it by tonight?
I need a drink.
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
I don't have to...
Why was the floor wet?
You're not a team player.
And you're a little fucking reject.
You're a loser.
You go home!
You don't know what you're doing.
Calling the ambulance.
Sure, why not.
Have you ever done this before?
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
What does that mean?
At the seven-eleven.
Adam! Calm down.
It has worked.
They're driving me nuts!
No...we want padded chairs...okay?
No. I think it's fucked.
It has to be done.
So where's that leave us?
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
The groom?
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
Here's his head.
What is her disposition?
Give me two more.
Well, I didn't mean it.
Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
He is not cracking up.
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
I'm serious.
Not a prayer.
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
Moore?
And what happens when you can't?
It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.
Government cutbacks.
We missed the deadline.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
I've seen it on television.
Of course.
Not yet.
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
Now?
Yeah. You.
No it's not okay. It's not.
The prostitute.
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
Have another drink.
No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.
What is it?
What?
Did she believe you?
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
Greenpeace?
My God...
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
I do.
...embarrassing, shameful...
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
So where to on the honeymoon?
Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
No, the children sleep with me.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
What about them?
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
Who is she?
Evil.
Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
Whatever you like.
Today I can refuse you nothing.
Go away! Leave me alone.
You must listen to me before you go.
I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
But what can I say to her, sir?
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
Fifteen yards.
He was asking for it.
What are you going to do?
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
That your cousin is more to your taste.
If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
I'm not like you, you have your wife.
Do they worry you that much, then?
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
How much do you want for him?
Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
You little liar! Get out of here!
But, miss ...
Mother.
I had so many things to think about!
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device  it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe online, yet?
What about them?
What she's going to do is get in my way.
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
I don't set policy.  You have the key?
Got it.
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment.
Only because I got pulled out early.
If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
I was assured the problem was corrected.
It feels so.. .real.
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
What I need is a nymphomaniac.
Turn it down!
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?
Help me get out of here.
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
That's not true, Parker.
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
Do me one favor  if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
I'm still working on it.
I've been in prison, remember?
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
As a matter of fact, it is.
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Enjoying yourself?
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
Because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
Sid?
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
Naw, we can't play this one catch-up.  That's how long since you stopped beating the wife.  We have to...
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
We've just found out They Have the Bomb.  We've Just Found Out They Have The <u>Bomb</u>, aaaand...

Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it....
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
In the yellow ribbon.

Knock on wood.
Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.

What are we gonna <u>do</u> about it...?
The War is Over.
First of all, we're locked <u>in</u> to it, <u>secondly</u>:
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
Oh.  Hell.  And what do we do now?  What do we do <u>now</u>? Boy Producer?  Mister Win-an-Emmy, Social Conscience, <u>Whaleshit</u>, save- the-rainforest, Liberal hire-a-convict <u>shithead</u>? Mister Affirmative-Action Peacnik.  Commie... <u>shithead</u>....?

Could we have you in here, please...7
Quite touching.
You gonna git me back tomorrow?  Cause they havin <u>beans</u> tomorrow...
It falls to me to <u>reveal</u> to you a <u>secret</u>.  To reveal the existence of a secret group of warriors. Men, yes, and <u>women</u>, trained and pledged their <u>strength</u>, their <u>skills</u>, and, if called upon, their <u>lives</u>, in the service of their fellow Americans. A group so secret, its very existence has been known to just a few, and known not by a Name, but by a Designation Number, Three-Oh-Three...
ON LIZ, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE H.Q., ON A BOARD WE SEE "DAYS TILL ELECTION 6" AND % IN FAVOR 82%.  A HUGE TV SHOWS THE PRESIDENT.

Heavy weather East of here.
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
Who're you working for?
I have a question for you.
I'll play your silly game.
When's he coming back...?
Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
We have some mutual friends in Washington.
How you going to stretch it?  This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.

"Freedom."

President's speech.
I saw it on TV.
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
Get it in the stacks at the Library of Congress, Now.  Who's seeing the guy at C.B.S.?
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
Of what?
...one more day.
Too Texan.  Go with the stick.  Thanks.  <u>What</u>...? ...does it have to be <u>Albania</u>...We're locked into Albania...why?
Why are they ...
He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
See y'at the Finish Line.
Leopard Skin...
Isn't Johnny Green in the... 
Yes.
Yeah, good good good good good.  And They're <u>So</u> <u>Secret</u>...
Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may rephrase, that the success of the President, in the Polls...
Yes. 
...for the beans, yes...
Cause the beans, y'know, y'can tell if they're <u>puttin</u> stuff in it.
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
Show some compassion.
No, I think it's ... can we see the calico <u>kitten</u>...?
Tell those spineless toads we'll self-insure if they don't write it... You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes...  You eating twinkies today, Bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess...
Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.
...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up...
Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today. 
Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!
All right, I owe you one Marv.
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... 
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
All right, Bud... let's do it.
So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
Oh no, no...
...I can't even see it...
Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
What? How do you know about my father?
Yes...
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?
But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.
How much?
Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen...  So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...
A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
Upper West Side.
Break it.
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it. 
...how do you know? You wish...
Oh Christ!
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
It's over you, Gordon.
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.
If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.
Yeah, yeah, OK
A body.  I mean we're talking major body
China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?
Thank you Jenkins
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
What?  Tony and China, together?
No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
That's not what you said last night.
China
Right behind you.
Hi there Sarah
Sell my soul?
Maybe before the event, never after.
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
Hey.
It's only two hours away.
A ghost?
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
Mm-hmm.
How do you know it's a she?
What does she look like?
Do you have any idea who she is?
Nope.
I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
Well, that's what we're here for.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
What do you think?  Guess.
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
I am.
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
She isn't here.
I have to go.
Um...sure.
Yeah.
You know where she is?
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
Of course.
This is...
I came in from my room...
Good.  I'm good.
Okay, I'm a little tender.
Kambucha mushroom tea...
So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
...no...no...no...
Please.  That's all I need.
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
I don't know.
M-E...
It's alright.
Jody, she's alive.
No.
Three o'clock.
After that.
Of him I think.
But what if something happens?
I know.
Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.
I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
Did you call about the Feurs?
What's going on, Claire?
What?
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
Well, that's a relief.
Harvey says he's amazing.
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
Claire, please...
Then where is she?
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
In the living room...
But I don't remember.
Yes.  The ghost.
STOP IT!
Since when?
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
STOP IT!
Claire--
So you fucked a student?!
DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!
You should have tried harder.
Get out of my way.
She can't be here without me.
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
:Well, they are.
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
I want to see my mother.
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
Stop it!
You - are - a - murderer.
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
Now, lasher - it is our time.
I'll tell OR we're bringing -
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
I bring her flowers too.
I LOVE him!
They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
I know.    you are my son -
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
You still feel that crazy...?
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
What about you coming down here...?
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
Hello..
I don't think of us that way - ever.
Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.
Mm-hmm...
I love you too.
Talking to me dear...?
What were you talking about...?
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
Papers...?
I've decided not to open a practice here  I want to set up a research clinic.  For infant genetic disorder.
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
I'm sorry - I didn't think
Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
Yes it is...
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
Yes - I have had it for years.
The touch?
It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?
I don't know...
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
Yes - I suppose so...
He doesn't need to...
No - I'll have you after
Yes I can...
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
At home alone - where were you?
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
Yes - one please.
You and your pep talks.
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
Jealousy is so unattractive.
From your lips, to God's ears.
Yeah?
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
Dad, please.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
Yeah.
I will not have my boys arguing.
They're in the ignition, silly.
Got it.
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
Everything.
Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in "Heaven?"
Most places are, Jimmy.
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning expos changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.
Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
That's not ENTIRELY true.
You never know around here.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
Well? Where the hell are you?
Amen to that.
I'm trembling with excitement.
That's refreshingly deviant.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
Yellow pages?
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
Oh. Goodness.
Like what?
Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
Rules are rules.
Tipping?
Me? The King of Coitus?
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
That's perfect.
I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
I... You know... I...
Eat a power bar.
And where might that be?
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
He was large?
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
I'd like that.
Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
I net a guy in a bar.
What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
You could say that.
Ray, you heard him...
Where's Lombardo?
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
I wanna go home now.
Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
No!
Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be.
Lombardo ever come out here?
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Nothing.
Curiosity, I guess.
I'm not on your property!
Hi, Mon.
You notice my new jumper?
No you don't.
I won't.
No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
That's not your line.
I love you.  Now give me the line.
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
That's right.
You can't...
Will they?
That's cop bullshit.
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
That's right.  That was his name.
The one you bought at school.
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
Goodbye, Sandra.
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
Aha?
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
Almost?
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
It's a repeating steam cannon!
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
Thank you.
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
I'm sure we will.
Really?
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
I've had some practice.
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
You bring the best out in a man.
My friend?
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
Nicely said, sir.
On my way to Denver...
You're not going to use it, are you?
Right.
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
They're not after me.  They want the baby.
My step-father's going to tear you apart.
I don't believe you.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
You hear trouble.
I hate this.
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
You?
I won't.
Well what did she say?
No.
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
Courage, Willow.
Me neither!
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
Cows. You know, cows?
Good, you start tomorrow.
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
They're Amish.
John, why?...
I thought I was the English.
Yes, sir.
Sure have, Sam.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in 
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
I would not be too sure.
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
I can't.
Two days.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!
Where's my baggy pants?
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens 
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
Say again?
I admit I don't know where he is.
Not yet.
You didn't have to...
I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
That is idle talk.
I don't think she knows.
Tight. But I'm working on him.
All right, where is he?
You might have killed him!
No... No. It is just the English way.
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
If any!
Hickory!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
Catch him, you fool!
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Whenever you wish.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
Stop her!
Oh...
Oh --!
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
No, but you tried to.
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Not nobody, not nohow!
But why?  Why?
Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
I think I'll miss you most of all.
What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
You're going to see a Wizard?
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
Ah --
Don't you start it, too!
What was that?
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
She - she can have my Witch Remover.
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
No, sir!
Hurry -- hurry --
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Go on!
You promised us real things -- a real...
But I still want one.
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Then its no longer a bomb?
I did kill us. She thinks were dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
Elektra would control it all.
Just wanted to put him on edge...
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
Shes not a girl anymore.
I was the one who brought that money in...
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
Who did you get it from?
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldnt have done it without you.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
You knew him well?
No. Youll be safe here.
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  Ive never told anyone that.
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
He used your exact words.
Soon shell be everywhere.
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
And the payoff on the tables?
Where?
Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
What class sub does your nephew run?
Your father...
Someone will come.
What do you think?
No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
Wrong answers?
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
Who is she?  Do you know her?
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
Because --
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
Cured, yes.
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
What is it?  How does it work?
What if youre wrong??

Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
Maybe not, but why take chances?
His . . . whatever.
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
Okay!
That's because --
I think he's going to the john.
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
Coward.  Giving up.
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
Isn't it true that you --
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
Am I free to go?
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
Who says you're the good guys?
That's exactly why we need them.
You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
Go to the water, it's that way!
Let me.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
That's would be me.
I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
Alright, so I'll get more.
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.
The corner. Anarchy 99.
A parachute. This does not argue well.
Had to do what I had to do.
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
Beast.
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
What's that?
I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
Not interested.
Suit yourself.
Senator?
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?
I'll go.
How?
Enough for a test.
What do you want with him?
What do you mean to do?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
No!
Victor Frankenstein.
Ugly, vicious rumous.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir?
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
Well... yes.
Whatever makes you happy.
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
Yes!... the laboratory.
This is the only library I know of.
I think you must be mistaken, sir.
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
A week.  Ten days at most.
Why did you do that?
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
How old are you, young man?
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
No, Fred ereck.
But they told me it was Ee gor.
I'm sure we will.
Why are you talking like that?
Wockers with the knockers???
What?
Could be raining!
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
If you like -- just hurry!
What?
Wait till he sees the bill.
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
Who are you talking to?
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
It wasn't me.
Give -- me -- your -- hand!
You can say that again.
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Act casual!
What did you find out?
How do you know it was a 'she'?
MMmmm!  MMmmm!
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts.........................
For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
How nice.
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Yes!
I think I'll...carry him.
This is not the finals -- just sing!
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
I listened extra careful to your "Stand To" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?
Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
